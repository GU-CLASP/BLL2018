5,English,"during his tenure as successor to bernd schuster, he brought in a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to the club, bringing back memories of laudrup as a player.","michael laudrup (born 15 june 1964) is a danish former footballer and the current manager of qatar stars league club al rayyan. he is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation by many pundits. he is the older brother of fellow retired footballer brian laudrup.  during his playing career, laudrup won league titles with ajax, barcelona, real madrid and juventus, playing mainly as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in other offensive positions. a world class playmaker, he was a member of johan cruyff's ""dream team"" at barcelona, where he won nine trophies, including four successive la liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the european cup in 1992. laudrup moved to arch-rivals real madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth la liga title in a row.  laudrup made his debut for the denmark national team on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. he starred in the 1986 fifa world cup, and from november 1994, he captained denmark for a total of 28 matches, including the victorious 1995 confederations cup tournament. he played alongside his brother brian in the denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 world cup, and retired as an active player after the tournament.  in 1999, laudrup was voted the best foreign player in spanish football over the preceding 25-year period and in april 2000 he was knighted, receiving the order of the dannebrog. in november 2003, to celebrate uefa's jubilee, he was selected as the golden player of denmark by the danish football association, their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. he was officially named the best danish footballer of all time by the danish football association (dbu) in november 2006. he was named by pelé in the fifa 100 list of the world's greatest living players at a fifa awards ceremony in 2004. in april 2013, he was named by ""marca"" in the ""best foreign eleven in real madrid's history"". he is by some considered the greatest scandinavian footballer ever, ahead of the likes of zlatan ibrahimović.  after retiring as a player, laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the denmark national team. he got his first manager job at former club brøndby in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 danish superliga championship. he chose not to extend his contract with brøndby in may 2006. he took over as coach of getafe and had notable success there. he brought the club comparative success in the copa del rey and uefa cup, and the team's attacking style received plaudits. on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed the manager of premier league club swansea city on a two-year contract. in his first season in south wales, he won the league cup, the first major english trophy in swansea's 100-year history. on 4 february 2014, he was sacked by swansea after a ""significant"" slump in the premier league, leaving them two points above the relegation zone.  born in frederiksberg, copenhagen, michael laudrup began playing football in father finn laudrup's childhood club vanløse. when finn laudrup became player/coach of brøndby if in 1973, the family moved to brøndby and both michael and his brother brian laudrup started playing for the club as well. michael followed his father to the top-flight danish 1st division club københavns boldklub in 1976, while brian remained at brøndby.  laudrup made his senior debut in 1981, and made his debut for the danish under-19 national team in february 1981. in all, he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels. he went back to play for brøndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the promotion of brøndby to the 1st division.  at brøndby, laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st division debut game, as fellow promoted team boldklubben 1909 were beaten 7–1. he scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st division. his accomplishments earned him the 1982 danish player of the year award. he played part of the 1983 season for brøndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending serie a champions juventus from italy in june 1983. it was the biggest transfer deal in danish football at the time, worth around $1 million. he was due to sign for liverpool the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, liverpool proposed a four-year contract and laudrup opted not to sign.  under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had polish midfielder zbigniew boniek and michel platini, juventus initially lent laudrup to newly promoted rome club lazio for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for juventus. with lazio, he scored two goals in his serie a debut, a 2–4 loss to hellas verona. in his first year at lazio, lazio narrowly avoided relegation, but as juventus wanted to keep boniek and platini, he stayed for another year. lazio started the 1984–85 season season poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to serie b. laudrup scored just one goal that season.  laudrup returned to juventus in summer 1985 to replace zbigniew boniek, playing alongside michel platini. in his first year at the club, he won the 1985–86 serie a as well as the intercontinental cup trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out; he was once again named danish player of the year in 1985. however, the following season was no success for laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries, much like the majority of juventus players, including platini. when platini retired in 1987, laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought welsh forward ian rush. but laudrup failed to live up to platini's standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the 1987–88 season.  after an unsuccessful season with juventus, laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in italy. in 1989, he joined spanish club barcelona on the premise that netherlands legend johan cruyff, his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. immediately, laudrup enjoyed major success under cruyff's leadership, citing the dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. he was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside dutch defender ronald koeman and bulgarian striker hristo stoichkov, who were the pillars of the ""barça"" ""dream team"", along with rising stars pep guardiola, josé mari bakero, and txiki begiristain.  the dream team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s ajax team, and won four consecutive la liga championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the 1991–92 european cup, along with the 1992 uefa super cup, 1989–90 copa del rey and 1991 and 1992 supercopa de españa titles. laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in spain during his barcelona years. when ""barça"" hired a fourth foreign star player, brazilian striker romário in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 european cup final 0–4 loss to milan (amid conflicts with cruyff), his time at barcelona was effectively over.  laudrup's departure from barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. reflecting on his time at barcelona, he commented, ""i think we played some very good football, and i think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. because everybody talked about begiristain, bakero, guardiola, stoichkov, and koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with ac milan in that period.""  in 1994, laudrup completed a controversial move from ""barça"" to real madrid after he fell-out with johan cruyff. on this, laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. it was the year before the 1994 fifa world cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.  despite widespread belief laudrup joined arch-rivals real madrid in an attempt to ""get back"" at cruyff, the decision was based on the fact real madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like barcelona when he decided to join them. laudrup said, ""people say i wanted to go to real madrid just to get revenge. i say revenge from what? i've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at barcelona]. i went to madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the world cup. i said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win.""  laudrup went on to guide real madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the ""barça"" stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs. after the initial success at real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. despite only playing two seasons at real madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in real madrid history in an internet survey by spanish newspaper ""marca"" when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. while playing with barcelona, he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals real madrid in the 1993–94 season. the following season while playing for real madrid, he aided in the revenge beating madrid gave ""barça"", the final score also ending 5–0.  in 1996, laudrup left real madrid to play for vissel kobe in japan, helping them to promotion from the second-tier japan football league to the j1 league. he was registered as a player in čelik zenica in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for čelik, but was signed as a player. after the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at dutch side ajax in 1998.  following his retirement, laudrup sometimes turned out to play for lyngby's old boys team in his spare time.  laudrup was called up for the denmark national team during brøndby's debut season in the top-flight. on his 18th birthday on 15 june 1982, he became the then-second-youngest danish national team player ever, following harald nielsen. despite playing for relegation battlers lazio, laudrup starred for the denmark national team at uefa euro 1984, playing all four of denmark's matches.  laudrup participated in the 1986 fifa world cup in mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of uruguay. he was also a part of the disappointing denmark squad at euro 1988, though laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of denmark's two goals.  following three matches in the qualification campaign for euro 1992, laudrup opted to quit the national team in november 1990 (alongside his brother brian laudrup and jan mølby) following differences with coach richard møller nielsen. the danes originally failed to qualify but were later given yugoslavia's place as yugoslavia were kicked out due to war in their country. notwithstanding their qualification, laudrup rated denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as denmark beat holders the netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper peter schmeichel surprisingly saving a marco van basten penalty in the shoot-out. in the final against world champions and favourites germany, the danes stunned the world with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from john jensen and kim vilfort, making it arguably the biggest surprise in a uefa european championship final.  laudrup returned to nielsen's danish squad in august 1993, but saw spain and the republic of ireland qualify for the 1994 world cup ahead of denmark. he scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against argentina, as denmark won the 1995 intercontinental cup. he also scored four goals in ten matches as denmark qualified for euro 1996, though the tournament would leave no positives for him.  laudrup's last matches for denmark came at the 1998 world cup, when he captained the nation to the quarter-final. laudrup made his 100th appearance for denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat of saudi arabia in lens. denmark was defeated 2–3 by brazil in the quarter-finals, and both michael and brian laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination. both brothers ended their international careers on a high note as both michael and brian were named in fifa's all-star team.  a quick, intelligent and talented midfielder, known for his pace on the ball, laudrup is regarded as one of the most effective and versatile attacking midfielders, as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game. although primarily an offensive playmaker, he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line, and was even deployed as a winger, as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, or as a second striker on occasion, in particular in his youth. laudrup is considered by many as one of the best passers of all time, and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever. he was ranked among the best players in europe, with the french three time european footballer of the year award winner michel platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals. despite being primarily a creative team player, he also possessed an accurate shot.  in a 2006 interview, laudrup's real madrid teammate raúl called him the best player he had ever played with. his barcelona teammate romário said the same, opining he was able to create and score goals almost at will, and ranked him the fifth-best player in the history of the game (behind pelé, diego maradona, himself and zinedine zidane). in addition to his playing ability, laudrup was known for his good conduct on the pitch and he never received a red card in his career.  throughout his career, laudrup was acclaimed for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep passes and dribbling ability. in regard to his vision, jorge valdano, the argentinian coach of laudrup in real madrid, said, ""[h]e has eyes everywhere."" his trademark move – looking one way and passing the other – fooled countless opponents during his career. the laudrup dribble, a feint also known as the ""croqueta"", was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender. his skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. this led to the expression ""made in laudrup"", widely used in spain about his creative style of play. numerous teammates of his have said, ""just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball.""  in barcelona, laudrup played alongside hristo stoichkov, who scored many goals from laudrup's passes, like iván zamorano (who called laudrup """"el genio"""" [""the genius""]) during laudrup's time at real madrid. zamorano was going through a hard spell in madrid, but when laudrup arrived to assist his goals, zamorano immediately became ""pichichi"", the top goalscorer of la liga. throughout his career, his number of assists were almost always the highest of his team. despite his reputation as one of the most technically gifted and creative players of his generation, certain players, pundits and managers have questioned laudrup's work rate and consistency throughout his career at times. his former juventus teammate and admirer michel platini, for example, even once said, ""[laudrup]'s the greatest player in the world, in training.""  after his playing career ended with ajax, laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the denmark national team head coach morten olsen in 2000. the national team would play a 4–2–3–1 formation, depending on two fast wingers and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. together, they led denmark to the knock-out stage of the 2002 world cup.  after his success as denmark assistant manager, laudrup signed on as manager for danish superliga club brøndby. as his assistant coach, he paired up with former danish championship winning manager john jensen, who had played alongside him in the denmark national team. at the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which olsen and he had coached at the national team. he renovated the brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme.  to ensure the defensive strength of the team, laudrup signed proven national team player morten wieghorst. he began his reign as brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 danish supercup. in his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the danish cup, after brøndby beat midtjylland 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the danish superliga. laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  in the following season, he again finished the season runners-up to first place copenhagen by just one point. however, he would not be denied in the 2004–05 season, where he finally led the team to the danish superliga title. in the same season, he also completed the double after he won his second danish cup in four seasons. this saw him being given his second danish manager of the year award. after finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 danish superliga, laudrup announced that he, along with assistant faxe jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. the pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left brøndby in june 2006.  laudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club real madrid and that he would replace lars lagerbäck as head coach of the sweden national team.  in 2007, brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium ""the michael laudrup lounge"", with laudrup's approval. his success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  on 21 june 2007, laudrup was linked to a move to madrid-based la liga club getafe by sports newspaper ""marca"". this was confirmed on 9 july 2007. during his stay in getafe, the club reached the final of the copa del rey, losing to valencia, and the quarter-finals of the uefa cup, losing in extra time to bayern munich.","his team, which was not one of the established powers in spanish football, enjoyed comparative success. however, he performed only one season as manager, resigning in may 2008.  after laudrup announced his departure from getafe, he was linked with jobs at barcelona, valencia, benfica, chelsea, blackburn rovers, panathinaikos, cska moscow and west ham united. he almost got the job at panathinaikos, but according to danish media, he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a spanish club. this request was not accepted by the greeks, who chose to hire henk ten cate instead.  on 12 september 2008, it was officially announced that laudrup had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage spartak moscow, replacing stanislav cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results. however, laudrup started on a poor note, winning just one of his first four league matches. he was subsequently sacked on 15 april 2009, just seven months on the job, in the wake of spartak's quarter-final 3–0 loss to dynamo moscow in the russian cup. the official statement from spartak read, ""from this point onwards, head coach michael laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results.""  on 22 october 2009, spanish media announced laudrup would be appointed as new manager of spanish side atlético madrid, replacing the short and unsuccessful run of abel resino, following atlético's 4–0 uefa champions league group stage defeat to chelsea. however, laudrup and atlético were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart. the day after, on 23 october, resino was sacked and quique sánchez flores was appointed as coach as the side's second-choice.  in july 2010, laudrup was appointed manager of mallorca on a contract lasting until the end of june 2012. in his first season, he kept the struggling mallorca side from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the uefa europa league due to its poor financial situation. at the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 27 september 2011, laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant, erik larsen. laudrup cited great frustration with lorenzo serra ferrer, the club's director of football, leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation.  on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed manager of swansea city on a two-year contract, becoming the first dane to manage in the premier league. he made several new signings after arriving at liberty stadium, including michu, chico flores, pablo hernández, jonathan de guzmán and ki sung-yueng. his first competitive match as swansea manager came as an impressive 0–5 away win at loftus road against queens park rangers.  at swansea, alan tate said that laudrup was considered to be the best player in training, despite being 48 years old. he has been commended for his choice of signings, most notably with michu, who scored 22 goals in 2012 for swansea after he signed him for a bargain €2.5 million from rayo vallecano. on 23 january 2013, he led swansea into their first ever major cup final after defeating reigning european champions chelsea 2–0 on aggregate over two legs in the league cup semi-finals.  on 7 february 2013, laudrup appointed former danish international midfielder morten wieghorst as his assistant after previously signing him as a player when laudrup was managing brøndby. laudrup would later say he ""certainly"" believes wieghorst ""can be manager"" of swansea, as ""he has experience from scottish football and is familiar with english football"". on 24 february, laudrup said he had no ""ambition to become the manager"" of a big club, because he could not ""have done everything for 10 years"" in management and then be fired ""after nine months"" for not winning any trophies. he also said it gave him ""much more pleasure to see how well"" he could do where he did not ""have to win all the time"".  on 24 february 2013, laudrup won his first trophy with swansea after his side beat bradford city 5–0 to win the football league cup at wembley. this was also swansea's first major trophy in english football in the club's history. after the match, he said, ""i'm very proud of my team today. i think it was a great performance."" he also hailed the win as the best in his managerial career, saying, ""as a manager it's absolutely at the top, winning a trophy for the first time in 100 years.""  following swansea's 1–0 win over newcastle united on 2 march 2013 and the club moving into eighth position in the top-half of the premier league table and seemingly safe from relegation with 40 points and ten games left, laudrup told that he wanted swansea to finish eighth, saying that it would be ""incredible"" and that ""coming eighth [will be] like winning the league"" for the club. because he felt ""the first seven spots"" were already taken by manchester united, manchester city, chelsea, tottenham hotspur, arsenal, liverpool and everton. on 3 march, though he had said that his ""intention"" was ""to stay"" in south wales for the next year, swansea chairman huw jenkins said that the club were in the ""process of looking for the next manager"" of the club in case laudrup did choose to leave the club.  on 8 march 2013, laudrup signed a new contract with swansea, keeping him at the club until 2015. reports indicated that he agreed to a contract with a release clause in the region of £5 million, much like the release clause brendan rodgers agreed to when he signed a contract extension at the liberty stadium four months prior to joining liverpool. on 10 may, however, he confirmed that his ""intention"" was to stay at swansea ""next season,"" saying that reports he wanted to leave wales was ""pure speculation.""  on 4 february 2014, laudrup was sacked by swansea following a poor run of form which left the club two points clear of relegation. at the time of the decision, the team had lost six out of their last eight league games.  on 30 june 2014, laudrup became the new manager of qatar stars league champions lekhwiya after signing a one-year deal. he guided the lekhwiya to a club-record qatar stars league and a crown prince cup double in his first season. the club also qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2015 afc champions league during his reign. on 17 june 2015, laudrup announced that he would not extend his contract, departing the club.  on 3 october 2016, laudrup was unveiled as the new manager of al rayyan on a two-year contract, replacing jorge fossati. his first match in charge was on 15 october 2016, when al rayyan faced al sailiya in an away match in the league, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw.  as assistant manager to morten olsen, the denmark national team employed a 4–2–3–1 system with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in attack. laudrup learnt from olsen and used the same tactical style with brøndby, with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style. he continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined getafe, ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the copa del rey final. however, at spartak moscow, he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the russian game, with the club unable to score enough goals ""per"" match.  as mallorca manager, laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game. in 2012, he joined swansea city as manager, replacing brendan rodgers. under rodgers, swansea were known to play a 4–3–3 approach with a lot of focus on passing, where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game. under laudrup, the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation, becoming more attacking while retaining the passing and pressing game. he also signed a number of new players, primarily from la liga, trying to bring the attacking style from spain to wales, which saw more goals scored. he said, ""you can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in spain right now.""  laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing, attacking brand of football and attractive, passing style of play throughout the season, which saw his side win the league cup, after beating bradford city a record 5–0 in the final. ""you can't ask players to do things that cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi are doing, but you can ask the easy things,"" he said. ""sometimes the easiest things in football, a simple pass five or eight yards, can be the most effective. that, everybody can learn.""  michael laudrup is part of a family with three generations of footballers. his uncle is former brøndby and aberdeen manager ebbe skovdahl. he is the son of former danish national team player finn laudrup and michael's oldest son mads laudrup has been the team captain of various danish youth national teams since january 2005, and his youngest son andreas laudrup was selected a part of the under-16 national team in march 2006.  michael laudrup has a younger brother, brian laudrup, who was also a footballer. brian laudrup is the record holder of danish player of the year awards with four, and was rated by fifa as the fifth-best player in the world in 1992. brian laudrup was in the euro 92 team of the tournament and world cup 98 team of the tournament. brian was also known for his part in the rangers squad which won nine consecutive titles in the 1990s. brian was a part of the trophy-winning danish national team at uefa euro 1992, but michael did not play in that championship due to differences with the national team coach richard møller nielsen and because he thought that the barring of yugoslavia for political, rather than football, reasons was not just. in 2004, both the laudrup brothers were named in the fifa 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by pelé as part of the celebration of fifa's 100th anniversary.  laudrup is married to siw retz laudrup. but with his ex-wife tina thunø, he had his elder son, mads. with his wife siw retz laudrup, he has two children, andreas and rebecca.  alongside his professional football career, laudrup began importing spanish wine to denmark starting in 1993. initially, the wine import was sort of a hobby, but business grew rapidly and today his company laudrup vin og gastronomi has over ten employees, runs a wine academy and imports wines from all over the world.  in 2004, michael laudrup was one of the founders of cepos, a danish classical liberal/free-market conservative think-tank.","4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 4","2, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4"

(born 15 june 1964) is a danish former footballer and the current manager of qatar stars league club al rayyan. he is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation by many pundits. he is the older brother of fellow retired footballer brian laudrup.  during his playing career, laudrup won league titles with ajax, barcelona, real madrid and juventus, playing mainly as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in other offensive positions. a world class playmaker, he was a member of johan cruyff's ""dream team"" at barcelona, where he won nine trophies, including four successive la liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the european cup in 1992. laudrup moved to arch-rivals real madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth la liga title in a row.  laudrup made his debut for the denmark national team on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. he starred in the 1986 fifa world cup, and from november 1994, he captained denmark for a total of 28 matches, including the victorious 1995 confederations cup tournament. he played alongside his brother brian in the denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 world cup, and retired as an active player after the tournament.  in 1999, laudrup was voted the best foreign player in spanish football over the preceding 25-year period and in april 2000 he was knighted, receiving the order of the dannebrog. in november 2003, to celebrate uefa's jubilee, he was selected as the golden player of denmark by the danish football association, their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. he was officially named the best danish footballer of all time by the danish football association (dbu) in november 2006. he was named by pelé in the fifa 100 list of the world's greatest living players at a fifa awards ceremony in 2004. in april 2013, he was named by ""marca"" in the ""best foreign eleven in real madrid's history"". he is by some considered the greatest scandinavian footballer ever, ahead of the likes of zlatan ibrahimović.  after retiring as a player, laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the denmark national team. he got his first manager job at former club brøndby in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 danish superliga championship. he chose not to extend his contract with brøndby in may 2006. he took over as coach of getafe and had notable success there. he brought the club comparative success in the copa del rey and uefa cup, and the team's attacking style received plaudits. on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed the manager of premier league club swansea city on a two-year contract. in his first season in south wales, he won the league cup, the first major english trophy in swansea's 100-year history. on 4 february 2014, he was sacked by swansea after a ""significant"" slump in the premier league, leaving them two points above the relegation zone.  born in frederiksberg, copenhagen, michael laudrup began playing football in father finn laudrup's childhood club vanløse. when finn laudrup became player/coach of brøndby if in 1973, the family moved to brøndby and both michael and his brother brian laudrup started playing for the club as well. michael followed his father to the top-flight danish 1st division club københavns boldklub in 1976, while brian remained at brøndby.  laudrup made his senior debut in 1981, and made his debut for the danish under-19 national team in february 1981. in all, he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels. he went back to play for brøndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the promotion of brøndby to the 1st division.  at brøndby, laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st division debut game, as fellow promoted team boldklubben 1909 were beaten 7–1. he scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st division. his accomplishments earned him the 1982 danish player of the year award. he played part of the 1983 season for brøndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending serie a champions juventus from italy in june 1983. it was the biggest transfer deal in danish football at the time, worth around $1 million. he was due to sign for liverpool the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, liverpool proposed a four-year contract and laudrup opted not to sign.  under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had polish midfielder zbigniew boniek and michel platini, juventus initially lent laudrup to newly promoted rome club lazio for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for juventus. with lazio, he scored two goals in his serie a debut, a 2–4 loss to hellas verona. in his first year at lazio, lazio narrowly avoided relegation, but as juventus wanted to keep boniek and platini, he stayed for another year. lazio started the 1984–85 season season poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to serie b. laudrup scored just one goal that season.  laudrup returned to juventus in summer 1985 to replace zbigniew boniek, playing alongside michel platini. in his first year at the club, he won the 1985–86 serie a as well as the intercontinental cup trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out; he was once again named danish player of the year in 1985. however, the following season was no success for laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries, much like the majority of juventus players, including platini. when platini retired in 1987, laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought welsh forward ian rush. but laudrup failed to live up to platini's standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the 1987–88 season.  after an unsuccessful season with juventus, laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in italy. in 1989, he joined spanish club barcelona on the premise that netherlands legend johan cruyff, his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. immediately, laudrup enjoyed major success under cruyff's leadership, citing the dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. he was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside dutch defender ronald koeman and bulgarian striker hristo stoichkov, who were the pillars of the ""barça"" ""dream team"", along with rising stars pep guardiola, josé mari bakero, and txiki begiristain.  the dream team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s ajax team, and won four consecutive la liga championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the 1991–92 european cup, along with the 1992 uefa super cup, 1989–90 copa del rey and 1991 and 1992 supercopa de españa titles. laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in spain during his barcelona years. when ""barça"" hired a fourth foreign star player, brazilian striker romário in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 european cup final 0–4 loss to milan (amid conflicts with cruyff), his time at barcelona was effectively over.  laudrup's departure from barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. reflecting on his time at barcelona, he commented, ""i think we played some very good football, and i think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. because everybody talked about begiristain, bakero, guardiola, stoichkov, and koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with ac milan in that period.""  in 1994, laudrup completed a controversial move from ""barça"" to real madrid after he fell-out with johan cruyff. on this, laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. it was the year before the 1994 fifa world cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.  despite widespread belief laudrup joined arch-rivals real madrid in an attempt to ""get back"" at cruyff, the decision was based on the fact real madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like barcelona when he decided to join them. laudrup said, ""people say i wanted to go to real madrid just to get revenge. i say revenge from what? i've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at barcelona]. i went to madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the world cup. i said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win.""  laudrup went on to guide real madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the ""barça"" stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs. after the initial success at real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. despite only playing two seasons at real madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in real madrid history in an internet survey by spanish newspaper ""marca"" when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. while playing with barcelona, he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals real madrid in the 1993–94 season. the following season while playing for real madrid, he aided in the revenge beating madrid gave ""barça"", the final score also ending 5–0.  in 1996, laudrup left real madrid to play for vissel kobe in japan, helping them to promotion from the second-tier japan football league to the j1 league. he was registered as a player in čelik zenica in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for čelik, but was signed as a player. after the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at dutch side ajax in 1998.  following his retirement, laudrup sometimes turned out to play for lyngby's old boys team in his spare time.  laudrup was called up for the denmark national team during brøndby's debut season in the top-flight. on his 18th birthday on 15 june 1982, he became the then-second-youngest danish national team player ever, following harald nielsen. despite playing for relegation battlers lazio, laudrup starred for the denmark national team at uefa euro 1984, playing all four of denmark's matches.  laudrup participated in the 1986 fifa world cup in mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of uruguay. he was also a part of the disappointing denmark squad at euro 1988, though laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of denmark's two goals.  following three matches in the qualification campaign for euro 1992, laudrup opted to quit the national team in november 1990 (alongside his brother brian laudrup and jan mølby) following differences with coach richard møller nielsen. the danes originally failed to qualify but were later given yugoslavia's place as yugoslavia were kicked out due to war in their country. notwithstanding their qualification, laudrup rated denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as denmark beat holders the netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper peter schmeichel surprisingly saving a marco van basten penalty in the shoot-out. in the final against world champions and favourites germany, the danes stunned the world with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from john jensen and kim vilfort, making it arguably the biggest surprise in a uefa european championship final.  laudrup returned to nielsen's danish squad in august 1993, but saw spain and the republic of ireland qualify for the 1994 world cup ahead of denmark. he scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against argentina, as denmark won the 1995 intercontinental cup. he also scored four goals in ten matches as denmark qualified for euro 1996, though the tournament would leave no positives for him.  laudrup's last matches for denmark came at the 1998 world cup, when he captained the nation to the quarter-final. laudrup made his 100th appearance for denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat of saudi arabia in lens. denmark was defeated 2–3 by brazil in the quarter-finals, and both michael and brian laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination. both brothers ended their international careers on a high note as both michael and brian were named in fifa's all-star team.  a quick, intelligent and talented midfielder, known for his pace on the ball, laudrup is regarded as one of the most effective and versatile attacking midfielders, as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game. although primarily an offensive playmaker, he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line, and was even deployed as a winger, as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, or as a second striker on occasion, in particular in his youth. laudrup is considered by many as one of the best passers of all time, and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever. he was ranked among the best players in europe, with the french three time european footballer of the year award winner michel platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals. despite being primarily a creative team player, he also possessed an accurate shot.  in a 2006 interview, laudrup's real madrid teammate raúl called him the best player he had ever played with. his barcelona teammate romário said the same, opining he was able to create and score goals almost at will, and ranked him the fifth-best player in the history of the game (behind pelé, diego maradona, himself and zinedine zidane). in addition to his playing ability, laudrup was known for his good conduct on the pitch and he never received a red card in his career.  throughout his career, laudrup was acclaimed for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep passes and dribbling ability. in regard to his vision, jorge valdano, the argentinian coach of laudrup in real madrid, said, ""[h]e has eyes everywhere."" his trademark move – looking one way and passing the other – fooled countless opponents during his career. the laudrup dribble, a feint also known as the ""croqueta"", was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender. his skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. this led to the expression ""made in laudrup"", widely used in spain about his creative style of play. numerous teammates of his have said, ""just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball.""  in barcelona, laudrup played alongside hristo stoichkov, who scored many goals from laudrup's passes, like iván zamorano (who called laudrup """"el genio"""" [""the genius""]) during laudrup's time at real madrid. zamorano was going through a hard spell in madrid, but when laudrup arrived to assist his goals, zamorano immediately became ""pichichi"", the top goalscorer of la liga. throughout his career, his number of assists were almost always the highest of his team. despite his reputation as one of the most technically gifted and creative players of his generation, certain players, pundits and managers have questioned laudrup's work rate and consistency throughout his career at times. his former juventus teammate and admirer michel platini, for example, even once said, ""[laudrup]'s the greatest player in the world, in training.""  after his playing career ended with ajax, laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the denmark national team head coach morten olsen in 2000. the national team would play a 4–2–3–1 formation, depending on two fast wingers and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. together, they led denmark to the knock-out stage of the 2002 world cup.  after his success as denmark assistant manager, laudrup signed on as manager for danish superliga club brøndby. as his assistant coach, he paired up with former danish championship winning manager john jensen, who had played alongside him in the denmark national team. at the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which olsen and he had coached at the national team. he renovated the brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme.  to ensure the defensive strength of the team, laudrup signed proven national team player morten wieghorst. he began his reign as brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 danish supercup. in his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the danish cup, after brøndby beat midtjylland 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the danish superliga. laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  in the following season, he again finished the season runners-up to first place copenhagen by just one point. however, he would not be denied in the 2004–05 season, where he finally led the team to the danish superliga title. in the same season, he also completed the double after he won his second danish cup in four seasons. this saw him being given his second danish manager of the year award. after finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 danish superliga, laudrup announced that he, along with assistant faxe jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. the pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left brøndby in june 2006.  laudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club real madrid and that he would replace lars lagerbäck as head coach of the sweden national team.  in 2007, brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium ""the michael laudrup lounge"", with laudrup's approval. his success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  on 21 june 2007, laudrup was linked to a move to madrid-based la liga club getafe by sports newspaper ""marca"". this was confirmed on 9 july 2007. during his stay in getafe, the club reached the final of the copa del rey, losing to valencia, and the quarter-finals of the uefa cup, losing in extra time to bayern munich.","his team, which was not one of the established powers in spanish football, enjoyed comparative success. however, he performed only one season as manager, resigning in may 2008.  after laudrup announced his departure from getafe, he was linked with jobs at barcelona, valencia, benfica, chelsea, blackburn rovers, panathinaikos, cska moscow and west ham united. he almost got the job at panathinaikos, but according to danish media, he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a spanish club. this request was not accepted by the greeks, who chose to hire henk ten cate instead.  on 12 september 2008, it was officially announced that laudrup had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage spartak moscow, replacing stanislav cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results. however, laudrup started on a poor note, winning just one of his first four league matches. he was subsequently sacked on 15 april 2009, just seven months on the job, in the wake of spartak's quarter-final 3–0 loss to dynamo moscow in the russian cup. the official statement from spartak read, ""from this point onwards, head coach michael laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results.""  on 22 october 2009, spanish media announced laudrup would be appointed as new manager of spanish side atlético madrid, replacing the short and unsuccessful run of abel resino, following atlético's 4–0 uefa champions league group stage defeat to chelsea. however, laudrup and atlético were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart. the day after, on 23 october, resino was sacked and quique sánchez flores was appointed as coach as the side's second-choice.  in july 2010, laudrup was appointed manager of mallorca on a contract lasting until the end of june 2012. in his first season, he kept the struggling mallorca side from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the uefa europa league due to its poor financial situation. at the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 27 september 2011, laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant, erik larsen. laudrup cited great frustration with lorenzo serra ferrer, the club's director of football, leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation.  on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed manager of swansea city on a two-year contract, becoming the first dane to manage in the premier league. he made several new signings after arriving at liberty stadium, including michu, chico flores, pablo hernández, jonathan de guzmán and ki sung-yueng. his first competitive match as swansea manager came as an impressive 0–5 away win at loftus road against queens park rangers.  at swansea, alan tate said that laudrup was considered to be the best player in training, despite being 48 years old. he has been commended for his choice of signings, most notably with michu, who scored 22 goals in 2012 for swansea after he signed him for a bargain €2.5 million from rayo vallecano. on 23 january 2013, he led swansea into their first ever major cup final after defeating reigning european champions chelsea 2–0 on aggregate over two legs in the league cup semi-finals.  on 7 february 2013, laudrup appointed former danish international midfielder morten wieghorst as his assistant after previously signing him as a player when laudrup was managing brøndby. laudrup would later say he ""certainly"" believes wieghorst ""can be manager"" of swansea, as ""he has experience from scottish football and is familiar with english football"". on 24 february, laudrup said he had no ""ambition to become the manager"" of a big club, because he could not ""have done everything for 10 years"" in management and then be fired ""after nine months"" for not winning any trophies. he also said it gave him ""much more pleasure to see how well"" he could do where he did not ""have to win all the time"".  on 24 february 2013, laudrup won his first trophy with swansea after his side beat bradford city 5–0 to win the football league cup at wembley. this was also swansea's first major trophy in english football in the club's history. after the match, he said, ""i'm very proud of my team today. i think it was a great performance."" he also hailed the win as the best in his managerial career, saying, ""as a manager it's absolutely at the top, winning a trophy for the first time in 100 years.""  following swansea's 1–0 win over newcastle united on 2 march 2013 and the club moving into eighth position in the top-half of the premier league table and seemingly safe from relegation with 40 points and ten games left, laudrup told that he wanted swansea to finish eighth, saying that it would be ""incredible"" and that ""coming eighth [will be] like winning the league"" for the club. because he felt ""the first seven spots"" were already taken by manchester united, manchester city, chelsea, tottenham hotspur, arsenal, liverpool and everton. on 3 march, though he had said that his ""intention"" was ""to stay"" in south wales for the next year, swansea chairman huw jenkins said that the club were in the ""process of looking for the next manager"" of the club in case laudrup did choose to leave the club.  on 8 march 2013, laudrup signed a new contract with swansea, keeping him at the club until 2015. reports indicated that he agreed to a contract with a release clause in the region of £5 million, much like the release clause brendan rodgers agreed to when he signed a contract extension at the liberty stadium four months prior to joining liverpool. on 10 may, however, he confirmed that his ""intention"" was to stay at swansea ""next season,"" saying that reports he wanted to leave wales was ""pure speculation.""  on 4 february 2014, laudrup was sacked by swansea following a poor run of form which left the club two points clear of relegation. at the time of the decision, the team had lost six out of their last eight league games.  on 30 june 2014, laudrup became the new manager of qatar stars league champions lekhwiya after signing a one-year deal. he guided the lekhwiya to a club-record qatar stars league and a crown prince cup double in his first season. the club also qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2015 afc champions league during his reign. on 17 june 2015, laudrup announced that he would not extend his contract, departing the club.  on 3 october 2016, laudrup was unveiled as the new manager of al rayyan on a two-year contract, replacing jorge fossati. his first match in charge was on 15 october 2016, when al rayyan faced al sailiya in an away match in the league, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw.  as assistant manager to morten olsen, the denmark national team employed a 4–2–3–1 system with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in attack. laudrup learnt from olsen and used the same tactical style with brøndby, with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style. he continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined getafe, ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the copa del rey final. however, at spartak moscow, he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the russian game, with the club unable to score enough goals ""per"" match.  as mallorca manager, laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game. in 2012, he joined swansea city as manager, replacing brendan rodgers. under rodgers, swansea were known to play a 4–3–3 approach with a lot of focus on passing, where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game. under laudrup, the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation, becoming more attacking while retaining the passing and pressing game. he also signed a number of new players, primarily from la liga, trying to bring the attacking style from spain to wales, which saw more goals scored. he said, ""you can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in spain right now.""  laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing, attacking brand of football and attractive, passing style of play throughout the season, which saw his side win the league cup, after beating bradford city a record 5–0 in the final. ""you can't ask players to do things that cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi are doing, but you can ask the easy things,"" he said. ""sometimes the easiest things in football, a simple pass five or eight yards, can be the most effective. that, everybody can learn.""  michael laudrup is part of a family with three generations of footballers. his uncle is former brøndby and aberdeen manager ebbe skovdahl. he is the son of former danish national team player finn laudrup and michael's oldest son mads laudrup has been the team captain of various danish youth national teams since january 2005, and his youngest son andreas laudrup was selected a part of the under-16 national team in march 2006.  michael laudrup has a younger brother, brian laudrup, who was also a footballer. brian laudrup is the record holder of danish player of the year awards with four, and was rated by fifa as the fifth-best player in the world in 1992. brian laudrup was in the euro 92 team of the tournament and world cup 98 team of the tournament. brian was also known for his part in the rangers squad which won nine consecutive titles in the 1990s. brian was a part of the trophy-winning danish national team at uefa euro 1992, but michael did not play in that championship due to differences with the national team coach richard møller nielsen and because he thought that the barring of yugoslavia for political, rather than football, reasons was not just. in 2004, both the laudrup brothers were named in the fifa 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by pelé as part of the celebration of fifa's 100th anniversary.  laudrup is married to siw retz laudrup. but with his ex-wife tina thunø, he had his elder son, mads. with his wife siw retz laudrup, he has two children, andreas and rebecca.  alongside his professional football career, laudrup began importing spanish wine to denmark starting in 1993. initially, the wine import was sort of a hobby, but business grew rapidly and today his company laudrup vin og gastronomi has over ten employees, runs a wine academy and imports wines from all over the world.  in 2004, michael laudrup was one of the founders of cepos, a danish classical liberal/free-market conservative think-tank.","2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1","1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2"
5,German,"during his term of office as successor to mr schuster, in a new brand exciting and free-flowing against football club, the memories of laudrup as player.","michael laudrup (born 15 june 1964) is a danish former footballer and the current manager of qatar stars league club al rayyan. he is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation by many pundits. he is the older brother of fellow retired footballer brian laudrup.  during his playing career, laudrup won league titles with ajax, barcelona, real madrid and juventus, playing mainly as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in other offensive positions. a world class playmaker, he was a member of johan cruyff's ""dream team"" at barcelona, where he won nine trophies, including four successive la liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the european cup in 1992. laudrup moved to arch-rivals real madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth la liga title in a row.  laudrup made his debut for the denmark national team on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. he starred in the 1986 fifa world cup, and from november 1994, he captained denmark for a total of 28 matches, including the victorious 1995 confederations cup tournament. he played alongside his brother brian in the denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 world cup, and retired as an active player after the tournament.  in 1999, laudrup was voted the best foreign player in spanish football over the preceding 25-year period and in april 2000 he was knighted, receiving the order of the dannebrog. in november 2003, to celebrate uefa's jubilee, he was selected as the golden player of denmark by the danish football association, their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. he was officially named the best danish footballer of all time by the danish football association (dbu) in november 2006. he was named by pelé in the fifa 100 list of the world's greatest living players at a fifa awards ceremony in 2004. in april 2013, he was named by ""marca"" in the ""best foreign eleven in real madrid's history"". he is by some considered the greatest scandinavian footballer ever, ahead of the likes of zlatan ibrahimović.  after retiring as a player, laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the denmark national team. he got his first manager job at former club brøndby in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 danish superliga championship. he chose not to extend his contract with brøndby in may 2006. he took over as coach of getafe and had notable success there. he brought the club comparative success in the copa del rey and uefa cup, and the team's attacking style received plaudits. on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed the manager of premier league club swansea city on a two-year contract. in his first season in south wales, he won the league cup, the first major english trophy in swansea's 100-year history. on 4 february 2014, he was sacked by swansea after a ""significant"" slump in the premier league, leaving them two points above the relegation zone.  born in frederiksberg, copenhagen, michael laudrup began playing football in father finn laudrup's childhood club vanløse. when finn laudrup became player/coach of brøndby if in 1973, the family moved to brøndby and both michael and his brother brian laudrup started playing for the club as well. michael followed his father to the top-flight danish 1st division club københavns boldklub in 1976, while brian remained at brøndby.  laudrup made his senior debut in 1981, and made his debut for the danish under-19 national team in february 1981. in all, he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels. he went back to play for brøndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the promotion of brøndby to the 1st division.  at brøndby, laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st division debut game, as fellow promoted team boldklubben 1909 were beaten 7–1. he scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st division. his accomplishments earned him the 1982 danish player of the year award. he played part of the 1983 season for brøndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending serie a champions juventus from italy in june 1983. it was the biggest transfer deal in danish football at the time, worth around $1 million. he was due to sign for liverpool the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, liverpool proposed a four-year contract and laudrup opted not to sign.  under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had polish midfielder zbigniew boniek and michel platini, juventus initially lent laudrup to newly promoted rome club lazio for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for juventus. with lazio, he scored two goals in his serie a debut, a 2–4 loss to hellas verona. in his first year at lazio, lazio narrowly avoided relegation, but as juventus wanted to keep boniek and platini, he stayed for another year. lazio started the 1984–85 season season poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to serie b. laudrup scored just one goal that season.  laudrup returned to juventus in summer 1985 to replace zbigniew boniek, playing alongside michel platini. in his first year at the club, he won the 1985–86 serie a as well as the intercontinental cup trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out; he was once again named danish player of the year in 1985. however, the following season was no success for laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries, much like the majority of juventus players, including platini. when platini retired in 1987, laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought welsh forward ian rush. but laudrup failed to live up to platini's standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the 1987–88 season.  after an unsuccessful season with juventus, laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in italy. in 1989, he joined spanish club barcelona on the premise that netherlands legend johan cruyff, his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. immediately, laudrup enjoyed major success under cruyff's leadership, citing the dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. he was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside dutch defender ronald koeman and bulgarian striker hristo stoichkov, who were the pillars of the ""barça"" ""dream team"", along with rising stars pep guardiola, josé mari bakero, and txiki begiristain.  the dream team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s ajax team, and won four consecutive la liga championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the 1991–92 european cup, along with the 1992 uefa super cup, 1989–90 copa del rey and 1991 and 1992 supercopa de españa titles. laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in spain during his barcelona years. when ""barça"" hired a fourth foreign star player, brazilian striker romário in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 european cup final 0–4 loss to milan (amid conflicts with cruyff), his time at barcelona was effectively over.  laudrup's departure from barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. reflecting on his time at barcelona, he commented, ""i think we played some very good football, and i think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. because everybody talked about begiristain, bakero, guardiola, stoichkov, and koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with ac milan in that period.""  in 1994, laudrup completed a controversial move from ""barça"" to real madrid after he fell-out with johan cruyff. on this, laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. it was the year before the 1994 fifa world cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.  despite widespread belief laudrup joined arch-rivals real madrid in an attempt to ""get back"" at cruyff, the decision was based on the fact real madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like barcelona when he decided to join them. laudrup said, ""people say i wanted to go to real madrid just to get revenge. i say revenge from what? i've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at barcelona]. i went to madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the world cup. i said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win.""  laudrup went on to guide real madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the ""barça"" stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs. after the initial success at real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. despite only playing two seasons at real madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in real madrid history in an internet survey by spanish newspaper ""marca"" when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. while playing with barcelona, he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals real madrid in the 1993–94 season. the following season while playing for real madrid, he aided in the revenge beating madrid gave ""barça"", the final score also ending 5–0.  in 1996, laudrup left real madrid to play for vissel kobe in japan, helping them to promotion from the second-tier japan football league to the j1 league. he was registered as a player in čelik zenica in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for čelik, but was signed as a player. after the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at dutch side ajax in 1998.  following his retirement, laudrup sometimes turned out to play for lyngby's old boys team in his spare time.  laudrup was called up for the denmark national team during brøndby's debut season in the top-flight. on his 18th birthday on 15 june 1982, he became the then-second-youngest danish national team player ever, following harald nielsen. despite playing for relegation battlers lazio, laudrup starred for the denmark national team at uefa euro 1984, playing all four of denmark's matches.  laudrup participated in the 1986 fifa world cup in mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of uruguay. he was also a part of the disappointing denmark squad at euro 1988, though laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of denmark's two goals.  following three matches in the qualification campaign for euro 1992, laudrup opted to quit the national team in november 1990 (alongside his brother brian laudrup and jan mølby) following differences with coach richard møller nielsen. the danes originally failed to qualify but were later given yugoslavia's place as yugoslavia were kicked out due to war in their country. notwithstanding their qualification, laudrup rated denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as denmark beat holders the netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper peter schmeichel surprisingly saving a marco van basten penalty in the shoot-out. in the final against world champions and favourites germany, the danes stunned the world with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from john jensen and kim vilfort, making it arguably the biggest surprise in a uefa european championship final.  laudrup returned to nielsen's danish squad in august 1993, but saw spain and the republic of ireland qualify for the 1994 world cup ahead of denmark. he scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against argentina, as denmark won the 1995 intercontinental cup. he also scored four goals in ten matches as denmark qualified for euro 1996, though the tournament would leave no positives for him.  laudrup's last matches for denmark came at the 1998 world cup, when he captained the nation to the quarter-final. laudrup made his 100th appearance for denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat of saudi arabia in lens. denmark was defeated 2–3 by brazil in the quarter-finals, and both michael and brian laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination. both brothers ended their international careers on a high note as both michael and brian were named in fifa's all-star team.  a quick, intelligent and talented midfielder, known for his pace on the ball, laudrup is regarded as one of the most effective and versatile attacking midfielders, as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game. although primarily an offensive playmaker, he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line, and was even deployed as a winger, as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, or as a second striker on occasion, in particular in his youth. laudrup is considered by many as one of the best passers of all time, and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever. he was ranked among the best players in europe, with the french three time european footballer of the year award winner michel platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals. despite being primarily a creative team player, he also possessed an accurate shot.  in a 2006 interview, laudrup's real madrid teammate raúl called him the best player he had ever played with. his barcelona teammate romário said the same, opining he was able to create and score goals almost at will, and ranked him the fifth-best player in the history of the game (behind pelé, diego maradona, himself and zinedine zidane). in addition to his playing ability, laudrup was known for his good conduct on the pitch and he never received a red card in his career.  throughout his career, laudrup was acclaimed for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep passes and dribbling ability. in regard to his vision, jorge valdano, the argentinian coach of laudrup in real madrid, said, ""[h]e has eyes everywhere."" his trademark move – looking one way and passing the other – fooled countless opponents during his career. the laudrup dribble, a feint also known as the ""croqueta"", was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender. his skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. this led to the expression ""made in laudrup"", widely used in spain about his creative style of play. numerous teammates of his have said, ""just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball.""  in barcelona, laudrup played alongside hristo stoichkov, who scored many goals from laudrup's passes, like iván zamorano (who called laudrup """"el genio"""" [""the genius""]) during laudrup's time at real madrid. zamorano was going through a hard spell in madrid, but when laudrup arrived to assist his goals, zamorano immediately became ""pichichi"", the top goalscorer of la liga. throughout his career, his number of assists were almost always the highest of his team. despite his reputation as one of the most technically gifted and creative players of his generation, certain players, pundits and managers have questioned laudrup's work rate and consistency throughout his career at times. his former juventus teammate and admirer michel platini, for example, even once said, ""[laudrup]'s the greatest player in the world, in training.""  after his playing career ended with ajax, laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the denmark national team head coach morten olsen in 2000. the national team would play a 4–2–3–1 formation, depending on two fast wingers and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. together, they led denmark to the knock-out stage of the 2002 world cup.  after his success as denmark assistant manager, laudrup signed on as manager for danish superliga club brøndby. as his assistant coach, he paired up with former danish championship winning manager john jensen, who had played alongside him in the denmark national team. at the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which olsen and he had coached at the national team. he renovated the brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme.  to ensure the defensive strength of the team, laudrup signed proven national team player morten wieghorst. he began his reign as brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 danish supercup. in his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the danish cup, after brøndby beat midtjylland 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the danish superliga. laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  in the following season, he again finished the season runners-up to first place copenhagen by just one point. however, he would not be denied in the 2004–05 season, where he finally led the team to the danish superliga title. in the same season, he also completed the double after he won his second danish cup in four seasons. this saw him being given his second danish manager of the year award. after finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 danish superliga, laudrup announced that he, along with assistant faxe jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. the pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left brøndby in june 2006.  laudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club real madrid and that he would replace lars lagerbäck as head coach of the sweden national team.  in 2007, brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium ""the michael laudrup lounge"", with laudrup's approval. his success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  on 21 june 2007, laudrup was linked to a move to madrid-based la liga club getafe by sports newspaper ""marca"". this was confirmed on 9 july 2007. during his stay in getafe, the club reached the final of the copa del rey, losing to valencia, and the quarter-finals of the uefa cup, losing in extra time to bayern munich.","his team, which was not one of the established powers in spanish football, enjoyed comparative success. however, he performed only one season as manager, resigning in may 2008.  after laudrup announced his departure from getafe, he was linked with jobs at barcelona, valencia, benfica, chelsea, blackburn rovers, panathinaikos, cska moscow and west ham united. he almost got the job at panathinaikos, but according to danish media, he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a spanish club. this request was not accepted by the greeks, who chose to hire henk ten cate instead.  on 12 september 2008, it was officially announced that laudrup had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage spartak moscow, replacing stanislav cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results. however, laudrup started on a poor note, winning just one of his first four league matches. he was subsequently sacked on 15 april 2009, just seven months on the job, in the wake of spartak's quarter-final 3–0 loss to dynamo moscow in the russian cup. the official statement from spartak read, ""from this point onwards, head coach michael laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results.""  on 22 october 2009, spanish media announced laudrup would be appointed as new manager of spanish side atlético madrid, replacing the short and unsuccessful run of abel resino, following atlético's 4–0 uefa champions league group stage defeat to chelsea. however, laudrup and atlético were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart. the day after, on 23 october, resino was sacked and quique sánchez flores was appointed as coach as the side's second-choice.  in july 2010, laudrup was appointed manager of mallorca on a contract lasting until the end of june 2012. in his first season, he kept the struggling mallorca side from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the uefa europa league due to its poor financial situation. at the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 27 september 2011, laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant, erik larsen. laudrup cited great frustration with lorenzo serra ferrer, the club's director of football, leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation.  on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed manager of swansea city on a two-year contract, becoming the first dane to manage in the premier league. he made several new signings after arriving at liberty stadium, including michu, chico flores, pablo hernández, jonathan de guzmán and ki sung-yueng. his first competitive match as swansea manager came as an impressive 0–5 away win at loftus road against queens park rangers.  at swansea, alan tate said that laudrup was considered to be the best player in training, despite being 48 years old. he has been commended for his choice of signings, most notably with michu, who scored 22 goals in 2012 for swansea after he signed him for a bargain €2.5 million from rayo vallecano. on 23 january 2013, he led swansea into their first ever major cup final after defeating reigning european champions chelsea 2–0 on aggregate over two legs in the league cup semi-finals.  on 7 february 2013, laudrup appointed former danish international midfielder morten wieghorst as his assistant after previously signing him as a player when laudrup was managing brøndby. laudrup would later say he ""certainly"" believes wieghorst ""can be manager"" of swansea, as ""he has experience from scottish football and is familiar with english football"". on 24 february, laudrup said he had no ""ambition to become the manager"" of a big club, because he could not ""have done everything for 10 years"" in management and then be fired ""after nine months"" for not winning any trophies. he also said it gave him ""much more pleasure to see how well"" he could do where he did not ""have to win all the time"".  on 24 february 2013, laudrup won his first trophy with swansea after his side beat bradford city 5–0 to win the football league cup at wembley. this was also swansea's first major trophy in english football in the club's history. after the match, he said, ""i'm very proud of my team today. i think it was a great performance."" he also hailed the win as the best in his managerial career, saying, ""as a manager it's absolutely at the top, winning a trophy for the first time in 100 years.""  following swansea's 1–0 win over newcastle united on 2 march 2013 and the club moving into eighth position in the top-half of the premier league table and seemingly safe from relegation with 40 points and ten games left, laudrup told that he wanted swansea to finish eighth, saying that it would be ""incredible"" and that ""coming eighth [will be] like winning the league"" for the club. because he felt ""the first seven spots"" were already taken by manchester united, manchester city, chelsea, tottenham hotspur, arsenal, liverpool and everton. on 3 march, though he had said that his ""intention"" was ""to stay"" in south wales for the next year, swansea chairman huw jenkins said that the club were in the ""process of looking for the next manager"" of the club in case laudrup did choose to leave the club.  on 8 march 2013, laudrup signed a new contract with swansea, keeping him at the club until 2015. reports indicated that he agreed to a contract with a release clause in the region of £5 million, much like the release clause brendan rodgers agreed to when he signed a contract extension at the liberty stadium four months prior to joining liverpool. on 10 may, however, he confirmed that his ""intention"" was to stay at swansea ""next season,"" saying that reports he wanted to leave wales was ""pure speculation.""  on 4 february 2014, laudrup was sacked by swansea following a poor run of form which left the club two points clear of relegation. at the time of the decision, the team had lost six out of their last eight league games.  on 30 june 2014, laudrup became the new manager of qatar stars league champions lekhwiya after signing a one-year deal. he guided the lekhwiya to a club-record qatar stars league and a crown prince cup double in his first season. the club also qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2015 afc champions league during his reign. on 17 june 2015, laudrup announced that he would not extend his contract, departing the club.  on 3 october 2016, laudrup was unveiled as the new manager of al rayyan on a two-year contract, replacing jorge fossati. his first match in charge was on 15 october 2016, when al rayyan faced al sailiya in an away match in the league, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw.  as assistant manager to morten olsen, the denmark national team employed a 4–2–3–1 system with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in attack. laudrup learnt from olsen and used the same tactical style with brøndby, with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style. he continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined getafe, ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the copa del rey final. however, at spartak moscow, he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the russian game, with the club unable to score enough goals ""per"" match.  as mallorca manager, laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game. in 2012, he joined swansea city as manager, replacing brendan rodgers. under rodgers, swansea were known to play a 4–3–3 approach with a lot of focus on passing, where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game. under laudrup, the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation, becoming more attacking while retaining the passing and pressing game. he also signed a number of new players, primarily from la liga, trying to bring the attacking style from spain to wales, which saw more goals scored. he said, ""you can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in spain right now.""  laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing, attacking brand of football and attractive, passing style of play throughout the season, which saw his side win the league cup, after beating bradford city a record 5–0 in the final. ""you can't ask players to do things that cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi are doing, but you can ask the easy things,"" he said. ""sometimes the easiest things in football, a simple pass five or eight yards, can be the most effective. that, everybody can learn.""  michael laudrup is part of a family with three generations of footballers. his uncle is former brøndby and aberdeen manager ebbe skovdahl. he is the son of former danish national team player finn laudrup and michael's oldest son mads laudrup has been the team captain of various danish youth national teams since january 2005, and his youngest son andreas laudrup was selected a part of the under-16 national team in march 2006.  michael laudrup has a younger brother, brian laudrup, who was also a footballer. brian laudrup is the record holder of danish player of the year awards with four, and was rated by fifa as the fifth-best player in the world in 1992. brian laudrup was in the euro 92 team of the tournament and world cup 98 team of the tournament. brian was also known for his part in the rangers squad which won nine consecutive titles in the 1990s. brian was a part of the trophy-winning danish national team at uefa euro 1992, but michael did not play in that championship due to differences with the national team coach richard møller nielsen and because he thought that the barring of yugoslavia for political, rather than football, reasons was not just. in 2004, both the laudrup brothers were named in the fifa 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by pelé as part of the celebration of fifa's 100th anniversary.  laudrup is married to siw retz laudrup. but with his ex-wife tina thunø, he had his elder son, mads. with his wife siw retz laudrup, he has two children, andreas and rebecca.  alongside his professional football career, laudrup began importing spanish wine to denmark starting in 1993. initially, the wine import was sort of a hobby, but business grew rapidly and today his company laudrup vin og gastronomi has over ten employees, runs a wine academy and imports wines from all over the world.  in 2004, michael laudrup was one of the founders of cepos, a danish classical liberal/free-market conservative think-tank.","2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1","2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3"
5,Spanish,"during your mandate as successor of mr schuster, has presented a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attack football clubs, bring memories of laudrup as player.","michael laudrup (born 15 june 1964) is a danish former footballer and the current manager of qatar stars league club al rayyan. he is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation by many pundits. he is the older brother of fellow retired footballer brian laudrup.  during his playing career, laudrup won league titles with ajax, barcelona, real madrid and juventus, playing mainly as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in other offensive positions. a world class playmaker, he was a member of johan cruyff's ""dream team"" at barcelona, where he won nine trophies, including four successive la liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the european cup in 1992. laudrup moved to arch-rivals real madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth la liga title in a row.  laudrup made his debut for the denmark national team on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. he starred in the 1986 fifa world cup, and from november 1994, he captained denmark for a total of 28 matches, including the victorious 1995 confederations cup tournament. he played alongside his brother brian in the denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 world cup, and retired as an active player after the tournament.  in 1999, laudrup was voted the best foreign player in spanish football over the preceding 25-year period and in april 2000 he was knighted, receiving the order of the dannebrog. in november 2003, to celebrate uefa's jubilee, he was selected as the golden player of denmark by the danish football association, their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. he was officially named the best danish footballer of all time by the danish football association (dbu) in november 2006. he was named by pelé in the fifa 100 list of the world's greatest living players at a fifa awards ceremony in 2004. in april 2013, he was named by ""marca"" in the ""best foreign eleven in real madrid's history"". he is by some considered the greatest scandinavian footballer ever, ahead of the likes of zlatan ibrahimović.  after retiring as a player, laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the denmark national team. he got his first manager job at former club brøndby in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 danish superliga championship. he chose not to extend his contract with brøndby in may 2006. he took over as coach of getafe and had notable success there. he brought the club comparative success in the copa del rey and uefa cup, and the team's attacking style received plaudits. on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed the manager of premier league club swansea city on a two-year contract. in his first season in south wales, he won the league cup, the first major english trophy in swansea's 100-year history. on 4 february 2014, he was sacked by swansea after a ""significant"" slump in the premier league, leaving them two points above the relegation zone.  born in frederiksberg, copenhagen, michael laudrup began playing football in father finn laudrup's childhood club vanløse. when finn laudrup became player/coach of brøndby if in 1973, the family moved to brøndby and both michael and his brother brian laudrup started playing for the club as well. michael followed his father to the top-flight danish 1st division club københavns boldklub in 1976, while brian remained at brøndby.  laudrup made his senior debut in 1981, and made his debut for the danish under-19 national team in february 1981. in all, he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels. he went back to play for brøndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the promotion of brøndby to the 1st division.  at brøndby, laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st division debut game, as fellow promoted team boldklubben 1909 were beaten 7–1. he scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st division. his accomplishments earned him the 1982 danish player of the year award. he played part of the 1983 season for brøndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending serie a champions juventus from italy in june 1983. it was the biggest transfer deal in danish football at the time, worth around $1 million. he was due to sign for liverpool the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, liverpool proposed a four-year contract and laudrup opted not to sign.  under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had polish midfielder zbigniew boniek and michel platini, juventus initially lent laudrup to newly promoted rome club lazio for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for juventus. with lazio, he scored two goals in his serie a debut, a 2–4 loss to hellas verona. in his first year at lazio, lazio narrowly avoided relegation, but as juventus wanted to keep boniek and platini, he stayed for another year. lazio started the 1984–85 season season poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to serie b. laudrup scored just one goal that season.  laudrup returned to juventus in summer 1985 to replace zbigniew boniek, playing alongside michel platini. in his first year at the club, he won the 1985–86 serie a as well as the intercontinental cup trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out; he was once again named danish player of the year in 1985. however, the following season was no success for laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries, much like the majority of juventus players, including platini. when platini retired in 1987, laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought welsh forward ian rush. but laudrup failed to live up to platini's standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the 1987–88 season.  after an unsuccessful season with juventus, laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in italy. in 1989, he joined spanish club barcelona on the premise that netherlands legend johan cruyff, his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. immediately, laudrup enjoyed major success under cruyff's leadership, citing the dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. he was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside dutch defender ronald koeman and bulgarian striker hristo stoichkov, who were the pillars of the ""barça"" ""dream team"", along with rising stars pep guardiola, josé mari bakero, and txiki begiristain.  the dream team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s ajax team, and won four consecutive la liga championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the 1991–92 european cup, along with the 1992 uefa super cup, 1989–90 copa del rey and 1991 and 1992 supercopa de españa titles. laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in spain during his barcelona years. when ""barça"" hired a fourth foreign star player, brazilian striker romário in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 european cup final 0–4 loss to milan (amid conflicts with cruyff), his time at barcelona was effectively over.  laudrup's departure from barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. reflecting on his time at barcelona, he commented, ""i think we played some very good football, and i think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. because everybody talked about begiristain, bakero, guardiola, stoichkov, and koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with ac milan in that period.""  in 1994, laudrup completed a controversial move from ""barça"" to real madrid after he fell-out with johan cruyff. on this, laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. it was the year before the 1994 fifa world cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.  despite widespread belief laudrup joined arch-rivals real madrid in an attempt to ""get back"" at cruyff, the decision was based on the fact real madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like barcelona when he decided to join them. laudrup said, ""people say i wanted to go to real madrid just to get revenge. i say revenge from what? i've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at barcelona]. i went to madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the world cup. i said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win.""  laudrup went on to guide real madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the ""barça"" stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs. after the initial success at real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. despite only playing two seasons at real madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in real madrid history in an internet survey by spanish newspaper ""marca"" when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. while playing with barcelona, he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals real madrid in the 1993–94 season. the following season while playing for real madrid, he aided in the revenge beating madrid gave ""barça"", the final score also ending 5–0.  in 1996, laudrup left real madrid to play for vissel kobe in japan, helping them to promotion from the second-tier japan football league to the j1 league. he was registered as a player in čelik zenica in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for čelik, but was signed as a player. after the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at dutch side ajax in 1998.  following his retirement, laudrup sometimes turned out to play for lyngby's old boys team in his spare time.  laudrup was called up for the denmark national team during brøndby's debut season in the top-flight. on his 18th birthday on 15 june 1982, he became the then-second-youngest danish national team player ever, following harald nielsen. despite playing for relegation battlers lazio, laudrup starred for the denmark national team at uefa euro 1984, playing all four of denmark's matches.  laudrup participated in the 1986 fifa world cup in mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of uruguay. he was also a part of the disappointing denmark squad at euro 1988, though laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of denmark's two goals.  following three matches in the qualification campaign for euro 1992, laudrup opted to quit the national team in november 1990 (alongside his brother brian laudrup and jan mølby) following differences with coach richard møller nielsen. the danes originally failed to qualify but were later given yugoslavia's place as yugoslavia were kicked out due to war in their country. notwithstanding their qualification, laudrup rated denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as denmark beat holders the netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper peter schmeichel surprisingly saving a marco van basten penalty in the shoot-out. in the final against world champions and favourites germany, the danes stunned the world with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from john jensen and kim vilfort, making it arguably the biggest surprise in a uefa european championship final.  laudrup returned to nielsen's danish squad in august 1993, but saw spain and the republic of ireland qualify for the 1994 world cup ahead of denmark. he scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against argentina, as denmark won the 1995 intercontinental cup. he also scored four goals in ten matches as denmark qualified for euro 1996, though the tournament would leave no positives for him.  laudrup's last matches for denmark came at the 1998 world cup, when he captained the nation to the quarter-final. laudrup made his 100th appearance for denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat of saudi arabia in lens. denmark was defeated 2–3 by brazil in the quarter-finals, and both michael and brian laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination. both brothers ended their international careers on a high note as both michael and brian were named in fifa's all-star team.  a quick, intelligent and talented midfielder, known for his pace on the ball, laudrup is regarded as one of the most effective and versatile attacking midfielders, as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game. although primarily an offensive playmaker, he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line, and was even deployed as a winger, as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, or as a second striker on occasion, in particular in his youth. laudrup is considered by many as one of the best passers of all time, and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever. he was ranked among the best players in europe, with the french three time european footballer of the year award winner michel platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals. despite being primarily a creative team player, he also possessed an accurate shot.  in a 2006 interview, laudrup's real madrid teammate raúl called him the best player he had ever played with. his barcelona teammate romário said the same, opining he was able to create and score goals almost at will, and ranked him the fifth-best player in the history of the game (behind pelé, diego maradona, himself and zinedine zidane). in addition to his playing ability, laudrup was known for his good conduct on the pitch and he never received a red card in his career.  throughout his career, laudrup was acclaimed for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep passes and dribbling ability. in regard to his vision, jorge valdano, the argentinian coach of laudrup in real madrid, said, ""[h]e has eyes everywhere."" his trademark move – looking one way and passing the other – fooled countless opponents during his career. the laudrup dribble, a feint also known as the ""croqueta"", was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender. his skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. this led to the expression ""made in laudrup"", widely used in spain about his creative style of play. numerous teammates of his have said, ""just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball.""  in barcelona, laudrup played alongside hristo stoichkov, who scored many goals from laudrup's passes, like iván zamorano (who called laudrup """"el genio"""" [""the genius""]) during laudrup's time at real madrid. zamorano was going through a hard spell in madrid, but when laudrup arrived to assist his goals, zamorano immediately became ""pichichi"", the top goalscorer of la liga. throughout his career, his number of assists were almost always the highest of his team. despite his reputation as one of the most technically gifted and creative players of his generation, certain players, pundits and managers have questioned laudrup's work rate and consistency throughout his career at times. his former juventus teammate and admirer michel platini, for example, even once said, ""[laudrup]'s the greatest player in the world, in training.""  after his playing career ended with ajax, laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the denmark national team head coach morten olsen in 2000. the national team would play a 4–2–3–1 formation, depending on two fast wingers and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. together, they led denmark to the knock-out stage of the 2002 world cup.  after his success as denmark assistant manager, laudrup signed on as manager for danish superliga club brøndby. as his assistant coach, he paired up with former danish championship winning manager john jensen, who had played alongside him in the denmark national team. at the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which olsen and he had coached at the national team. he renovated the brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme.  to ensure the defensive strength of the team, laudrup signed proven national team player morten wieghorst. he began his reign as brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 danish supercup. in his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the danish cup, after brøndby beat midtjylland 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the danish superliga. laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  in the following season, he again finished the season runners-up to first place copenhagen by just one point. however, he would not be denied in the 2004–05 season, where he finally led the team to the danish superliga title. in the same season, he also completed the double after he won his second danish cup in four seasons. this saw him being given his second danish manager of the year award. after finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 danish superliga, laudrup announced that he, along with assistant faxe jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. the pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left brøndby in june 2006.  laudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club real madrid and that he would replace lars lagerbäck as head coach of the sweden national team.  in 2007, brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium ""the michael laudrup lounge"", with laudrup's approval. his success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  on 21 june 2007, laudrup was linked to a move to madrid-based la liga club getafe by sports newspaper ""marca"". this was confirmed on 9 july 2007. during his stay in getafe, the club reached the final of the copa del rey, losing to valencia, and the quarter-finals of the uefa cup, losing in extra time to bayern munich.","his team, which was not one of the established powers in spanish football, enjoyed comparative success. however, he performed only one season as manager, resigning in may 2008.  after laudrup announced his departure from getafe, he was linked with jobs at barcelona, valencia, benfica, chelsea, blackburn rovers, panathinaikos, cska moscow and west ham united. he almost got the job at panathinaikos, but according to danish media, he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a spanish club. this request was not accepted by the greeks, who chose to hire henk ten cate instead.  on 12 september 2008, it was officially announced that laudrup had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage spartak moscow, replacing stanislav cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results. however, laudrup started on a poor note, winning just one of his first four league matches. he was subsequently sacked on 15 april 2009, just seven months on the job, in the wake of spartak's quarter-final 3–0 loss to dynamo moscow in the russian cup. the official statement from spartak read, ""from this point onwards, head coach michael laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results.""  on 22 october 2009, spanish media announced laudrup would be appointed as new manager of spanish side atlético madrid, replacing the short and unsuccessful run of abel resino, following atlético's 4–0 uefa champions league group stage defeat to chelsea. however, laudrup and atlético were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart. the day after, on 23 october, resino was sacked and quique sánchez flores was appointed as coach as the side's second-choice.  in july 2010, laudrup was appointed manager of mallorca on a contract lasting until the end of june 2012. in his first season, he kept the struggling mallorca side from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the uefa europa league due to its poor financial situation. at the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 27 september 2011, laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant, erik larsen. laudrup cited great frustration with lorenzo serra ferrer, the club's director of football, leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation.  on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed manager of swansea city on a two-year contract, becoming the first dane to manage in the premier league. he made several new signings after arriving at liberty stadium, including michu, chico flores, pablo hernández, jonathan de guzmán and ki sung-yueng. his first competitive match as swansea manager came as an impressive 0–5 away win at loftus road against queens park rangers.  at swansea, alan tate said that laudrup was considered to be the best player in training, despite being 48 years old. he has been commended for his choice of signings, most notably with michu, who scored 22 goals in 2012 for swansea after he signed him for a bargain €2.5 million from rayo vallecano. on 23 january 2013, he led swansea into their first ever major cup final after defeating reigning european champions chelsea 2–0 on aggregate over two legs in the league cup semi-finals.  on 7 february 2013, laudrup appointed former danish international midfielder morten wieghorst as his assistant after previously signing him as a player when laudrup was managing brøndby. laudrup would later say he ""certainly"" believes wieghorst ""can be manager"" of swansea, as ""he has experience from scottish football and is familiar with english football"". on 24 february, laudrup said he had no ""ambition to become the manager"" of a big club, because he could not ""have done everything for 10 years"" in management and then be fired ""after nine months"" for not winning any trophies. he also said it gave him ""much more pleasure to see how well"" he could do where he did not ""have to win all the time"".  on 24 february 2013, laudrup won his first trophy with swansea after his side beat bradford city 5–0 to win the football league cup at wembley. this was also swansea's first major trophy in english football in the club's history. after the match, he said, ""i'm very proud of my team today. i think it was a great performance."" he also hailed the win as the best in his managerial career, saying, ""as a manager it's absolutely at the top, winning a trophy for the first time in 100 years.""  following swansea's 1–0 win over newcastle united on 2 march 2013 and the club moving into eighth position in the top-half of the premier league table and seemingly safe from relegation with 40 points and ten games left, laudrup told that he wanted swansea to finish eighth, saying that it would be ""incredible"" and that ""coming eighth [will be] like winning the league"" for the club. because he felt ""the first seven spots"" were already taken by manchester united, manchester city, chelsea, tottenham hotspur, arsenal, liverpool and everton. on 3 march, though he had said that his ""intention"" was ""to stay"" in south wales for the next year, swansea chairman huw jenkins said that the club were in the ""process of looking for the next manager"" of the club in case laudrup did choose to leave the club.  on 8 march 2013, laudrup signed a new contract with swansea, keeping him at the club until 2015. reports indicated that he agreed to a contract with a release clause in the region of £5 million, much like the release clause brendan rodgers agreed to when he signed a contract extension at the liberty stadium four months prior to joining liverpool. on 10 may, however, he confirmed that his ""intention"" was to stay at swansea ""next season,"" saying that reports he wanted to leave wales was ""pure speculation.""  on 4 february 2014, laudrup was sacked by swansea following a poor run of form which left the club two points clear of relegation. at the time of the decision, the team had lost six out of their last eight league games.  on 30 june 2014, laudrup became the new manager of qatar stars league champions lekhwiya after signing a one-year deal. he guided the lekhwiya to a club-record qatar stars league and a crown prince cup double in his first season. the club also qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2015 afc champions league during his reign. on 17 june 2015, laudrup announced that he would not extend his contract, departing the club.  on 3 october 2016, laudrup was unveiled as the new manager of al rayyan on a two-year contract, replacing jorge fossati. his first match in charge was on 15 october 2016, when al rayyan faced al sailiya in an away match in the league, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw.  as assistant manager to morten olsen, the denmark national team employed a 4–2–3–1 system with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in attack. laudrup learnt from olsen and used the same tactical style with brøndby, with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style. he continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined getafe, ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the copa del rey final. however, at spartak moscow, he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the russian game, with the club unable to score enough goals ""per"" match.  as mallorca manager, laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game. in 2012, he joined swansea city as manager, replacing brendan rodgers. under rodgers, swansea were known to play a 4–3–3 approach with a lot of focus on passing, where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game. under laudrup, the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation, becoming more attacking while retaining the passing and pressing game. he also signed a number of new players, primarily from la liga, trying to bring the attacking style from spain to wales, which saw more goals scored. he said, ""you can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in spain right now.""  laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing, attacking brand of football and attractive, passing style of play throughout the season, which saw his side win the league cup, after beating bradford city a record 5–0 in the final. ""you can't ask players to do things that cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi are doing, but you can ask the easy things,"" he said. ""sometimes the easiest things in football, a simple pass five or eight yards, can be the most effective. that, everybody can learn.""  michael laudrup is part of a family with three generations of footballers. his uncle is former brøndby and aberdeen manager ebbe skovdahl. he is the son of former danish national team player finn laudrup and michael's oldest son mads laudrup has been the team captain of various danish youth national teams since january 2005, and his youngest son andreas laudrup was selected a part of the under-16 national team in march 2006.  michael laudrup has a younger brother, brian laudrup, who was also a footballer. brian laudrup is the record holder of danish player of the year awards with four, and was rated by fifa as the fifth-best player in the world in 1992. brian laudrup was in the euro 92 team of the tournament and world cup 98 team of the tournament. brian was also known for his part in the rangers squad which won nine consecutive titles in the 1990s. brian was a part of the trophy-winning danish national team at uefa euro 1992, but michael did not play in that championship due to differences with the national team coach richard møller nielsen and because he thought that the barring of yugoslavia for political, rather than football, reasons was not just. in 2004, both the laudrup brothers were named in the fifa 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by pelé as part of the celebration of fifa's 100th anniversary.  laudrup is married to siw retz laudrup. but with his ex-wife tina thunø, he had his elder son, mads. with his wife siw retz laudrup, he has two children, andreas and rebecca.  alongside his professional football career, laudrup began importing spanish wine to denmark starting in 1993. initially, the wine import was sort of a hobby, but business grew rapidly and today his company laudrup vin og gastronomi has over ten employees, runs a wine academy and imports wines from all over the world.  in 2004, michael laudrup was one of the founders of cepos, a danish classical liberal/free-market conservative think-tank.","1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2","3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 2"

laudrup (born 15 june 1964) is a danish former footballer and the current manager of qatar stars league club al rayyan. he is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation by many pundits. he is the older brother of fellow retired footballer brian laudrup.  during his playing career, laudrup won league titles with ajax, barcelona, real madrid and juventus, playing mainly as an attacking midfielder, although he was also capable of playing in other offensive positions. a world class playmaker, he was a member of johan cruyff's ""dream team"" at barcelona, where he won nine trophies, including four successive la liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and the european cup in 1992. laudrup moved to arch-rivals real madrid in 1994, with whom he won his fifth la liga title in a row.  laudrup made his debut for the denmark national team on his 18th birthday in 1982, and scored 37 goals in 104 appearances. he starred in the 1986 fifa world cup, and from november 1994, he captained denmark for a total of 28 matches, including the victorious 1995 confederations cup tournament. he played alongside his brother brian in the denmark team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1998 world cup, and retired as an active player after the tournament.  in 1999, laudrup was voted the best foreign player in spanish football over the preceding 25-year period and in april 2000 he was knighted, receiving the order of the dannebrog. in november 2003, to celebrate uefa's jubilee, he was selected as the golden player of denmark by the danish football association, their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. he was officially named the best danish footballer of all time by the danish football association (dbu) in november 2006. he was named by pelé in the fifa 100 list of the world's greatest living players at a fifa awards ceremony in 2004. in april 2013, he was named by ""marca"" in the ""best foreign eleven in real madrid's history"". he is by some considered the greatest scandinavian footballer ever, ahead of the likes of zlatan ibrahimović.  after retiring as a player, laudrup took up coaching, and became assistant manager of the denmark national team. he got his first manager job at former club brøndby in 2002, whom he guided to the 2005 danish superliga championship. he chose not to extend his contract with brøndby in may 2006. he took over as coach of getafe and had notable success there. he brought the club comparative success in the copa del rey and uefa cup, and the team's attacking style received plaudits. on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed the manager of premier league club swansea city on a two-year contract. in his first season in south wales, he won the league cup, the first major english trophy in swansea's 100-year history. on 4 february 2014, he was sacked by swansea after a ""significant"" slump in the premier league, leaving them two points above the relegation zone.  born in frederiksberg, copenhagen, michael laudrup began playing football in father finn laudrup's childhood club vanløse. when finn laudrup became player/coach of brøndby if in 1973, the family moved to brøndby and both michael and his brother brian laudrup started playing for the club as well. michael followed his father to the top-flight danish 1st division club københavns boldklub in 1976, while brian remained at brøndby.  laudrup made his senior debut in 1981, and made his debut for the danish under-19 national team in february 1981. in all, he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels. he went back to play for brøndby in 1982, where his father had ended his career in 1981, contributing to the promotion of brøndby to the 1st division.  at brøndby, laudrup scored two goals in the club's 1st division debut game, as fellow promoted team boldklubben 1909 were beaten 7–1. he scored 15 league goals in 1982, and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st division. his accomplishments earned him the 1982 danish player of the year award. he played part of the 1983 season for brøndby, and scored nine goals, before he was sold to defending serie a champions juventus from italy in june 1983. it was the biggest transfer deal in danish football at the time, worth around $1 million. he was due to sign for liverpool the same year on a three-year contract, but at the last minute, liverpool proposed a four-year contract and laudrup opted not to sign.  under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team, of which the club had polish midfielder zbigniew boniek and michel platini, juventus initially lent laudrup to newly promoted rome club lazio for a single season, something he had not been informed about before signing for juventus. with lazio, he scored two goals in his serie a debut, a 2–4 loss to hellas verona. in his first year at lazio, lazio narrowly avoided relegation, but as juventus wanted to keep boniek and platini, he stayed for another year. lazio started the 1984–85 season season poorly, eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to serie b. laudrup scored just one goal that season.  laudrup returned to juventus in summer 1985 to replace zbigniew boniek, playing alongside michel platini. in his first year at the club, he won the 1985–86 serie a as well as the intercontinental cup trophy, scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament, although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out; he was once again named danish player of the year in 1985. however, the following season was no success for laudrup, who suffered multiple injuries, much like the majority of juventus players, including platini. when platini retired in 1987, laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place, playing alongside newly bought welsh forward ian rush. but laudrup failed to live up to platini's standards and did not score any goals, despite playing all 30 matches of the 1987–88 season.  after an unsuccessful season with juventus, laudrup decided it was time to leave, looking for a new experience after six years in italy. in 1989, he joined spanish club barcelona on the premise that netherlands legend johan cruyff, his childhood role model, had been assembling a team that was striving for success. immediately, laudrup enjoyed major success under cruyff's leadership, citing the dutchman's philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent. he was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team, alongside dutch defender ronald koeman and bulgarian striker hristo stoichkov, who were the pillars of the ""barça"" ""dream team"", along with rising stars pep guardiola, josé mari bakero, and txiki begiristain.  the dream team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s ajax team, and won four consecutive la liga championships from 1991 to 1994, as well as the 1991–92 european cup, along with the 1992 uefa super cup, 1989–90 copa del rey and 1991 and 1992 supercopa de españa titles. laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in spain during his barcelona years. when ""barça"" hired a fourth foreign star player, brazilian striker romário in 1993, it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match, and when he was not selected for the 1994 european cup final 0–4 loss to milan (amid conflicts with cruyff), his time at barcelona was effectively over.  laudrup's departure from barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike. reflecting on his time at barcelona, he commented, ""i think we played some very good football, and i think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world, you can have the best team. because everybody talked about begiristain, bakero, guardiola, stoichkov, and koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe the best team in the world, together with ac milan in that period.""  in 1994, laudrup completed a controversial move from ""barça"" to real madrid after he fell-out with johan cruyff. on this, laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda. it was the year before the 1994 fifa world cup and according to him, because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament, he correctly predicted that barcelona would not win major trophies the following season.  despite widespread belief laudrup joined arch-rivals real madrid in an attempt to ""get back"" at cruyff, the decision was based on the fact real madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy, like barcelona when he decided to join them. laudrup said, ""people say i wanted to go to real madrid just to get revenge. i say revenge from what? i've had a perfect time; five fantastic years here [at barcelona]. i went to madrid because they were so hungry to win, and they had four or five players who went to the world cup. i said this would be perfect; new coach, new players, and hungry to win.""  laudrup went on to guide real madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the ""barça"" stranglehold, making him the only player ever to win the spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs. after the initial success at real, a lacklustre season would be in store for the club. despite only playing two seasons at real madrid, he was voted the 12th-best player in real madrid history in an internet survey by spanish newspaper ""marca"" when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002. while playing with barcelona, he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals real madrid in the 1993–94 season. the following season while playing for real madrid, he aided in the revenge beating madrid gave ""barça"", the final score also ending 5–0.  in 1996, laudrup left real madrid to play for vissel kobe in japan, helping them to promotion from the second-tier japan football league to the j1 league. he was registered as a player in čelik zenica in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for čelik, but was signed as a player. after the details were resolved, he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at dutch side ajax in 1998.  following his retirement, laudrup sometimes turned out to play for lyngby's old boys team in his spare time.  laudrup was called up for the denmark national team during brøndby's debut season in the top-flight. on his 18th birthday on 15 june 1982, he became the then-second-youngest danish national team player ever, following harald nielsen. despite playing for relegation battlers lazio, laudrup starred for the denmark national team at uefa euro 1984, playing all four of denmark's matches.  laudrup participated in the 1986 fifa world cup in mexico, a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of uruguay. he was also a part of the disappointing denmark squad at euro 1988, though laudrup experienced personal success, scoring one of denmark's two goals.  following three matches in the qualification campaign for euro 1992, laudrup opted to quit the national team in november 1990 (alongside his brother brian laudrup and jan mølby) following differences with coach richard møller nielsen. the danes originally failed to qualify but were later given yugoslavia's place as yugoslavia were kicked out due to war in their country. notwithstanding their qualification, laudrup rated denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as denmark beat holders the netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper peter schmeichel surprisingly saving a marco van basten penalty in the shoot-out. in the final against world champions and favourites germany, the danes stunned the world with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from john jensen and kim vilfort, making it arguably the biggest surprise in a uefa european championship final.  laudrup returned to nielsen's danish squad in august 1993, but saw spain and the republic of ireland qualify for the 1994 world cup ahead of denmark. he scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against argentina, as denmark won the 1995 intercontinental cup. he also scored four goals in ten matches as denmark qualified for euro 1996, though the tournament would leave no positives for him.  laudrup's last matches for denmark came at the 1998 world cup, when he captained the nation to the quarter-final. laudrup made his 100th appearance for denmark in the team's opening game of the tournament, a 1–0 defeat of saudi arabia in lens. denmark was defeated 2–3 by brazil in the quarter-finals, and both michael and brian laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination. both brothers ended their international careers on a high note as both michael and brian were named in fifa's all-star team.  a quick, intelligent and talented midfielder, known for his pace on the ball, laudrup is regarded as one of the most effective and versatile attacking midfielders, as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game. although primarily an offensive playmaker, he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line, and was even deployed as a winger, as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, or as a second striker on occasion, in particular in his youth. laudrup is considered by many as one of the best passers of all time, and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever. he was ranked among the best players in europe, with the french three time european footballer of the year award winner michel platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever, only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals. despite being primarily a creative team player, he also possessed an accurate shot.  in a 2006 interview, laudrup's real madrid teammate raúl called him the best player he had ever played with. his barcelona teammate romário said the same, opining he was able to create and score goals almost at will, and ranked him the fifth-best player in the history of the game (behind pelé, diego maradona, himself and zinedine zidane). in addition to his playing ability, laudrup was known for his good conduct on the pitch and he never received a red card in his career.  throughout his career, laudrup was acclaimed for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep passes and dribbling ability. in regard to his vision, jorge valdano, the argentinian coach of laudrup in real madrid, said, ""[h]e has eyes everywhere."" his trademark move – looking one way and passing the other – fooled countless opponents during his career. the laudrup dribble, a feint also known as the ""croqueta"", was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender. his skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. this led to the expression ""made in laudrup"", widely used in spain about his creative style of play. numerous teammates of his have said, ""just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball.""  in barcelona, laudrup played alongside hristo stoichkov, who scored many goals from laudrup's passes, like iván zamorano (who called laudrup """"el genio"""" [""the genius""]) during laudrup's time at real madrid. zamorano was going through a hard spell in madrid, but when laudrup arrived to assist his goals, zamorano immediately became ""pichichi"", the top goalscorer of la liga. throughout his career, his number of assists were almost always the highest of his team. despite his reputation as one of the most technically gifted and creative players of his generation, certain players, pundits and managers have questioned laudrup's work rate and consistency throughout his career at times. his former juventus teammate and admirer michel platini, for example, even once said, ""[laudrup]'s the greatest player in the world, in training.""  after his playing career ended with ajax, laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the denmark national team head coach morten olsen in 2000. the national team would play a 4–2–3–1 formation, depending on two fast wingers and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game. together, they led denmark to the knock-out stage of the 2002 world cup.  after his success as denmark assistant manager, laudrup signed on as manager for danish superliga club brøndby. as his assistant coach, he paired up with former danish championship winning manager john jensen, who had played alongside him in the denmark national team. at the start of his reign, he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which olsen and he had coached at the national team. he renovated the brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave, in favour of several new offensive players, and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club's youth scheme.  to ensure the defensive strength of the team, laudrup signed proven national team player morten wieghorst. he began his reign as brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career, the 2002 danish supercup. in his first season as head coach, he guided the team to win the danish cup, after brøndby beat midtjylland 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the danish superliga. laudrup's success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  in the following season, he again finished the season runners-up to first place copenhagen by just one point. however, he would not be denied in the 2004–05 season, where he finally led the team to the danish superliga title. in the same season, he also completed the double after he won his second danish cup in four seasons. this saw him being given his second danish manager of the year award. after finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 danish superliga, laudrup announced that he, along with assistant faxe jensen, could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club. the pair, after winning four trophies in four seasons, subsequently left brøndby in june 2006.  laudrup was associated with several new jobs, including becoming manager of former club real madrid and that he would replace lars lagerbäck as head coach of the sweden national team.  in 2007, brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium ""the michael laudrup lounge"", with laudrup's approval. his success led him to being voted and awarded the danish manager of the year.  on 21 june 2007, laudrup was linked to a move to madrid-based la liga club getafe by sports newspaper ""marca"". this was confirmed on 9 july 2007. during his stay in getafe, the club reached the final of the copa del rey, losing to valencia, and the quarter-finals of the uefa cup, losing in extra time to bayern munich.","his team, which was not one of the established powers in spanish football, enjoyed comparative success. however, he performed only one season as manager, resigning in may 2008.  after laudrup announced his departure from getafe, he was linked with jobs at barcelona, valencia, benfica, chelsea, blackburn rovers, panathinaikos, cska moscow and west ham united. he almost got the job at panathinaikos, but according to danish media, he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a spanish club. this request was not accepted by the greeks, who chose to hire henk ten cate instead.  on 12 september 2008, it was officially announced that laudrup had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage spartak moscow, replacing stanislav cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results. however, laudrup started on a poor note, winning just one of his first four league matches. he was subsequently sacked on 15 april 2009, just seven months on the job, in the wake of spartak's quarter-final 3–0 loss to dynamo moscow in the russian cup. the official statement from spartak read, ""from this point onwards, head coach michael laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results.""  on 22 october 2009, spanish media announced laudrup would be appointed as new manager of spanish side atlético madrid, replacing the short and unsuccessful run of abel resino, following atlético's 4–0 uefa champions league group stage defeat to chelsea. however, laudrup and atlético were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart. the day after, on 23 october, resino was sacked and quique sánchez flores was appointed as coach as the side's second-choice.  in july 2010, laudrup was appointed manager of mallorca on a contract lasting until the end of june 2012. in his first season, he kept the struggling mallorca side from relegation, which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the uefa europa league due to its poor financial situation. at the beginning of the 2011–12 season, on 27 september 2011, laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant, erik larsen. laudrup cited great frustration with lorenzo serra ferrer, the club's director of football, leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation.  on 15 june 2012, laudrup was appointed manager of swansea city on a two-year contract, becoming the first dane to manage in the premier league. he made several new signings after arriving at liberty stadium, including michu, chico flores, pablo hernández, jonathan de guzmán and ki sung-yueng. his first competitive match as swansea manager came as an impressive 0–5 away win at loftus road against queens park rangers.  at swansea, alan tate said that laudrup was considered to be the best player in training, despite being 48 years old. he has been commended for his choice of signings, most notably with michu, who scored 22 goals in 2012 for swansea after he signed him for a bargain €2.5 million from rayo vallecano. on 23 january 2013, he led swansea into their first ever major cup final after defeating reigning european champions chelsea 2–0 on aggregate over two legs in the league cup semi-finals.  on 7 february 2013, laudrup appointed former danish international midfielder morten wieghorst as his assistant after previously signing him as a player when laudrup was managing brøndby. laudrup would later say he ""certainly"" believes wieghorst ""can be manager"" of swansea, as ""he has experience from scottish football and is familiar with english football"". on 24 february, laudrup said he had no ""ambition to become the manager"" of a big club, because he could not ""have done everything for 10 years"" in management and then be fired ""after nine months"" for not winning any trophies. he also said it gave him ""much more pleasure to see how well"" he could do where he did not ""have to win all the time"".  on 24 february 2013, laudrup won his first trophy with swansea after his side beat bradford city 5–0 to win the football league cup at wembley. this was also swansea's first major trophy in english football in the club's history. after the match, he said, ""i'm very proud of my team today. i think it was a great performance."" he also hailed the win as the best in his managerial career, saying, ""as a manager it's absolutely at the top, winning a trophy for the first time in 100 years.""  following swansea's 1–0 win over newcastle united on 2 march 2013 and the club moving into eighth position in the top-half of the premier league table and seemingly safe from relegation with 40 points and ten games left, laudrup told that he wanted swansea to finish eighth, saying that it would be ""incredible"" and that ""coming eighth [will be] like winning the league"" for the club. because he felt ""the first seven spots"" were already taken by manchester united, manchester city, chelsea, tottenham hotspur, arsenal, liverpool and everton. on 3 march, though he had said that his ""intention"" was ""to stay"" in south wales for the next year, swansea chairman huw jenkins said that the club were in the ""process of looking for the next manager"" of the club in case laudrup did choose to leave the club.  on 8 march 2013, laudrup signed a new contract with swansea, keeping him at the club until 2015. reports indicated that he agreed to a contract with a release clause in the region of £5 million, much like the release clause brendan rodgers agreed to when he signed a contract extension at the liberty stadium four months prior to joining liverpool. on 10 may, however, he confirmed that his ""intention"" was to stay at swansea ""next season,"" saying that reports he wanted to leave wales was ""pure speculation.""  on 4 february 2014, laudrup was sacked by swansea following a poor run of form which left the club two points clear of relegation. at the time of the decision, the team had lost six out of their last eight league games.  on 30 june 2014, laudrup became the new manager of qatar stars league champions lekhwiya after signing a one-year deal. he guided the lekhwiya to a club-record qatar stars league and a crown prince cup double in his first season. the club also qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2015 afc champions league during his reign. on 17 june 2015, laudrup announced that he would not extend his contract, departing the club.  on 3 october 2016, laudrup was unveiled as the new manager of al rayyan on a two-year contract, replacing jorge fossati. his first match in charge was on 15 october 2016, when al rayyan faced al sailiya in an away match in the league, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw.  as assistant manager to morten olsen, the denmark national team employed a 4–2–3–1 system with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in attack. laudrup learnt from olsen and used the same tactical style with brøndby, with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style. he continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined getafe, ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the copa del rey final. however, at spartak moscow, he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the russian game, with the club unable to score enough goals ""per"" match.  as mallorca manager, laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game. in 2012, he joined swansea city as manager, replacing brendan rodgers. under rodgers, swansea were known to play a 4–3–3 approach with a lot of focus on passing, where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game. under laudrup, the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation, becoming more attacking while retaining the passing and pressing game. he also signed a number of new players, primarily from la liga, trying to bring the attacking style from spain to wales, which saw more goals scored. he said, ""you can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in spain right now.""  laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing, attacking brand of football and attractive, passing style of play throughout the season, which saw his side win the league cup, after beating bradford city a record 5–0 in the final.

21,English,"halos can have many forms, ranging from colored or white rings to arcs and spots in the sky.","halo (from greek , ""halōs"") is the name for a family of optical phenomena produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.","many of these are near the sun or moon, but others occur elsewhere or even in the opposite part of the sky. among the best known halo types are the circular halo (properly called the 22° halo), light pillars and sun dogs, but there are many more; some of them fairly common, others (extremely) rare.  the ice crystals responsible for halos are typically suspended in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds high (5–10 km, or 3–6 miles) in the upper troposphere, but in cold weather they can also float near the ground, in which case they are referred to as diamond dust. the particular shape and orientation of the crystals are responsible for the type of halo observed. light is reflected and refracted by the ice crystals and may split up into colors because of dispersion. the crystals behave like prisms and mirrors, refracting and reflecting light between their faces, sending shafts of light in particular directions.  atmospheric phenomena such as halos were used as part of weather lore as an empirical means of weather forecasting before meteorology was developed. they often do mean that rain is going to fall within the next 24 hours as the cirrostratus clouds that cause them can signify an approaching frontal system.  other common optical phenomena involving water droplets rather than ice crystals include the glory and the rainbow.  while aristotle had mentioned halos and parhelia, in antiquity, the first european descriptions of complex displays were those of christoph scheiner in rome (circa 1630), hevelius in danzig (1661), and tobias lowitz in st petersburg (c. 1794). chinese observers had recorded these for centuries, the first reference being a section of the ""official history of the chin dynasty"" (""chin shu"") in 637, on the ""ten haloes"", giving technical terms for 26 solar halo phenomena.  a light pillar, or sun pillar, appears as a vertical pillar or column of light rising from the sun near sunset or sunrise, though it can appear below the sun, particularly if the observer is at a high elevation or altitude. hexagonal plate- and column-shaped ice crystals cause the phenomenon. plate crystals generally cause pillars only when the sun is within 6 degrees of the horizon, or below it; column crystals can cause a pillar when the sun is as high as 20 degrees above the horizon. the crystals tend to orient themselves near-horizontally as they fall or float through the air, and the width and visibility of a sun pillar depend on crystal alignment.  light pillars can also form around the moon, and around street lights or other bright lights. pillars forming from ground-based light sources may appear much taller than those associated with the sun or moon. since the observer is closer to the light source, crystal orientation matters less in the formation of these pillars.  among the best-known halos is the 22° halo, often just called ""halo"", which appears as a large ring around the sun or moon with a radius of about 22° (roughly the width of an outstretched hand at arm's length). the ice crystals that cause the 22° halo are oriented semi-randomly in the atmosphere, in contrast to the horizontal orientation required for some other halos such as sun dogs and light pillars. as a result of the optical properties of the ice crystals involved, no light is reflected towards the inside of the ring, leaving the sky noticeably darker than the sky around it, and giving it the impression of a ""hole in the sky"". the 22° halo is not to be confused with the corona, which is a different optical phenomenon caused by water droplets rather than ice crystals, and which has the appearance of a multicolored disk rather than a ring.  other haloes can form at 46° to the sun, or at the horizon, or around the zenith, and can appear as full haloes or incomplete arcs.  a ""bottlinger's ring"" is a rare type of halo that is elliptical instead of circular. it has a small diameter, which makes it very difficult to see in the sun's glare and more likely to be spotted around the dimmer subsun, often seen from mountain tops or airplanes. bottlinger's rings are not well understood yet. it is suggested that they are formed by very flat pyramidal ice crystals with faces at uncommonly low angles, suspended horizontally in the atmosphere. these precise and physically problematic requirements would explain why the halo is very rare.  in the anglo-cornish dialect of english, a halo round the sun or the moon is called a ""cock's eye"" and is a token of bad weather. the term is related to the breton word ""kog-heol"" (sun cock) which has the same meaning. in nepal, the halo round the sun is called ""indrasabha"" with a connotation of the assembly court of lord indra – the hindu god of lightning, thunder and rain.  the natural phenomena may be reproduced artificially by several means. firstly, by computer simulations, or secondly by experimental means. regarding the latter, one may either take a single crystal and rotate it around the appropriate axis/axes, or take a chemical approach. a still further and more indirect experimental approach is to find analogous refraction geometries.   this approach employs the fact that in some cases the average geometry of refraction through an ice crystal may be imitated / mimicked via the refraction through another geometrical object. in this way, the circumzenithal arc, the circumhorizontal arc and the suncave parry arcs may be recreated by refraction through rotationally symmetric (i.e. non-prismatic) static bodies. a particularly simple table-top experiment reproduces artificially the colorful circumzenithal and circumhorizontal arcs using a water glass only. the refraction through the cylinder of water turns out to be (almost) identical to the rotationally averaged refraction through an upright hexagonal ice crystal / plate-oriented crystals, thereby creating vividly colored circumzenithal and the circumhorizontal arcs. in fact, the water glass experiment is often confused as representing a rainbow and has been around at least since 1920.  following huygens' idea of the (false) mechanism of the 22° parhelia, one may also illuminate (from the side) a water-filled cylindrical glass with an inner central obstruction of half the glasses' diameter to achieve upon projection on a screen an appearance which closely resembles parhelia (cf. footnote [39] in ref. , or see here), i.e. an inner red edge transitioning into a white band at larger angles on both sides of the direct transmission direction. however, while the visual match is close, this particular experiment does not involve a fake caustic mechanism and is thus no real analogue.  the earliest chemical recipes to generate artificial halos has been put forward by brewster and studied further by a. cornu in 1889.  the earliest experimental studies on halo phenomena have been attributed to auguste bravais in 1847. bravais used an equilateral glass prism which he spun around its vertical axis. when illuminated by parallel white light, this produced an artificial parhelic circle and many of the embedded parhelia. similarly, a. wegener used hexagonal rotating crystals to produce artificial subparhelia. in a more recent version of this experiment, many more embedded parhelia have been found using commercially available hexagonal bk7 glass crystals. simple experiments like these can be used for educational purposes and demonstration experiments. unfortunately, using glass crystals one cannot reproduce the circumzenithal arc or the circumhorizontal arc due to total internal reflections preventing the required ray-paths when formula_1.  even earlier than bravais, the italian scientist f. venturi experimented with pointed water-filled prisms to demonstrate the circumzenithal arc. however, this explanation was replaced later by the cza's correct explanation by bravais.  in order to produce artificial halos such as the tangent arcs or the circumscribed halo one should rotate a single columnar hexagonal crystal about 2 axes. similarly, the lowitz arcs can be created by rotating a single plate crystal about two axes. this can be done by engineered halo machines. the first such machine was constructed in 2003; several more followed. putting such machines inside spherical projection screens, and by the principle of the so-called sky transform, the analogy is nearly perfect. a realization using micro-versions of the aforementioned machines produces authentic distortion-free

21,Czech,"halos can take many forms, starting with the colored or white rings on arcs and deficiencies in the sky.","halo (from greek , ""halōs"") is the name for a family of optical phenomena produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere.","many of these are near the sun or moon, but others occur elsewhere or even in the opposite part of the sky. among the best known halo types are the circular halo (properly called the 22° halo), light pillars and sun dogs, but there are many more; some of them fairly common, others (extremely) rare.  the ice crystals responsible for halos are typically suspended in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds high (5–10 km, or 3–6 miles) in the upper troposphere, but in cold weather they can also float near the ground, in which case they are referred to as diamond dust. the particular shape and orientation of the crystals are responsible for the type of halo observed. light is reflected and refracted by the ice crystals and may split up into colors because of dispersion. the crystals behave like prisms and mirrors, refracting and reflecting light between their faces, sending shafts of light in particular directions.  atmospheric phenomena such as halos were used as part of weather lore as an empirical means of weather forecasting before meteorology was developed. they often do mean that rain is going to fall within the next 24 hours as the cirrostratus clouds that cause them can signify an approaching frontal system.  other common optical phenomena involving water droplets rather than ice crystals include the glory and the rainbow.  while aristotle had mentioned halos and parhelia, in antiquity, the first european descriptions of complex displays were those of christoph scheiner in rome (circa 1630), hevelius in danzig (1661), and tobias lowitz in st petersburg (c. 1794). chinese observers had recorded these for centuries, the first reference being a section of the ""official history of the chin dynasty"" (""chin shu"") in 637, on the ""ten haloes"", giving technical terms for 26 solar halo phenomena.  a light pillar, or sun pillar, appears as a vertical pillar or column of light rising from the sun near sunset or sunrise, though it can appear below the sun, particularly if the observer is at a high elevation or altitude. hexagonal plate- and column-shaped ice crystals cause the phenomenon. plate crystals generally cause pillars only when the sun is within 6 degrees of the horizon, or below it; column crystals can cause a pillar when the sun is as high as 20 degrees above the horizon. the crystals tend to orient themselves near-horizontally as they fall or float through the air, and the width and visibility of a sun pillar depend on crystal alignment.  light pillars can also form around the moon, and around street lights or other bright lights. pillars forming from ground-based light sources may appear much taller than those associated with the sun or moon. since the observer is closer to the light source, crystal orientation matters less in the formation of these pillars.  among the best-known halos is the 22° halo, often just called ""halo"", which appears as a large ring around the sun or moon with a radius of about 22° (roughly the width of an outstretched hand at arm's length). the ice crystals that cause the 22° halo are oriented semi-randomly in the atmosphere, in contrast to the horizontal orientation required for some other halos such as sun dogs and light pillars. as a result of the optical properties of the ice crystals involved, no light is reflected towards the inside of the ring, leaving the sky noticeably darker than the sky around it, and giving it the impression of a ""hole in the sky"". the 22° halo is not to be confused with the corona, which is a different optical phenomenon caused by water droplets rather than ice crystals, and which has the appearance of a multicolored disk rather than a ring.  other haloes can form at 46° to the sun, or at the horizon, or around the zenith, and can appear as full haloes or incomplete arcs.  a ""bottlinger's ring"" is a rare type of halo that is elliptical instead of circular. it has a small diameter, which makes it very difficult to see in the sun's glare and more likely to be spotted around the dimmer subsun, often seen from mountain tops or airplanes. bottlinger's rings are not well understood yet. it is suggested that they are formed by very flat pyramidal ice crystals with faces at uncommonly low angles, suspended horizontally in the atmosphere. these precise and physically problematic requirements would explain why the halo is very rare.  in the anglo-cornish dialect of english, a halo round the sun or the moon is called a ""cock's eye"" and is a token of bad weather. the term is related to the breton word ""kog-heol"" (sun cock) which has the same meaning. in nepal, the halo round the sun is called ""indrasabha"" with a connotation of the assembly court of lord indra – the hindu god of lightning, thunder and rain.  the natural phenomena may be reproduced artificially by several means. firstly, by computer simulations, or secondly by experimental means. regarding the latter, one may either take a single crystal and rotate it around the appropriate axis/axes, or take a chemical approach. a still further and more indirect experimental approach is to find analogous refraction geometries.   this approach employs the fact that in some cases the average geometry of refraction through an ice crystal may be imitated / mimicked via the refraction through another geometrical object. in this way, the circumzenithal arc, the circumhorizontal arc and the suncave parry arcs may be recreated by refraction through rotationally symmetric (i.e. non-prismatic) static bodies. a particularly simple table-top experiment reproduces artificially the colorful circumzenithal and circumhorizontal arcs using a water glass only. the refraction through the cylinder of water turns out to be (almost) identical to the rotationally averaged refraction through an upright hexagonal ice crystal / plate-oriented crystals, thereby creating vividly colored circumzenithal and the circumhorizontal arcs. in fact, the water glass experiment is often confused as representing a rainbow and has been around at least since 1920.  following huygens' idea of the (false) mechanism of the 22° parhelia, one may also illuminate (from the side) a water-filled cylindrical glass with an inner central obstruction of half the glasses' diameter to achieve upon projection on a screen an appearance which closely resembles parhelia (cf. footnote [39] in ref. , or see here), i.e. an inner red edge transitioning into a white band at larger angles on both sides of the direct transmission direction. however, while the visual match is close, this particular experiment does not involve a fake caustic mechanism and is thus no real analogue.  the earliest chemical recipes to generate artificial halos has been put forward by brewster and studied further by a. cornu in 1889.  the earliest experimental studies on halo phenomena have been attributed to auguste bravais in 1847. bravais used an equilateral glass prism which he spun around its vertical axis. when illuminated by parallel white light, this produced an artificial parhelic circle and many of the embedded parhelia. similarly, a. wegener used hexagonal rotating crystals to produce artificial subparhelia. in a more recent version of this experiment, many more embedded parhelia have been found using commercially available hexagonal bk7 glass crystals. simple experiments like these can be used for educational purposes and demonstration experiments. unfortunately, using glass crystals one cannot reproduce the circumzenithal arc or the circumhorizontal arc due to total internal reflections preventing the required ray-paths when formula_1.  even earlier than bravais, the italian scientist f. venturi experimented with pointed water-filled prisms to demonstrate the circumzenithal arc. however, this explanation was replaced later by the cza's correct explanation by bravais.  in order to produce artificial halos such as the tangent arcs or the circumscribed halo one should rotate a single columnar hexagonal crystal about 2 axes. similarly, the lowitz arcs can be created by rotating a single plate crystal about two axes. this can be done by engineered halo machines. the first such machine was constructed in 2003; several more followed. putting such machines inside spherical projection screens, and by the principle of the so-called sky transform, the analogy is nearly perfect. a realization using micro-versions of the aforementioned machines produces authentic distortion-free projections of such complex artificial halos. finally, superposition of several images and projections produced by such halo machines may be combined to create a single image. the

chemical recipes to generate artificial halos has been put forward by brewster and studied further by a. cornu in 1889.  the earliest experimental studies on halo phenomena have been attributed to auguste bravais in 1847. bravais used an equilateral glass prism which he spun around its vertical axis. when illuminated by parallel white light, this produced an artificial parhelic circle and many of the embedded parhelia. similarly, a. wegener used hexagonal rotating crystals to produce artificial subparhelia. in a more recent version of this experiment, many more embedded parhelia have been found using commercially available hexagonal bk7 glass crystals. simple experiments like these can be used for educational purposes and demonstration experiments. unfortunately, using glass crystals one cannot reproduce the circumzenithal arc or the circumhorizontal arc due to total internal reflections preventing the required ray-paths when formula_1.  even earlier than bravais, the italian scientist f. venturi experimented with pointed water-filled prisms to demonstrate the circumzenithal arc. however, this explanation was replaced later by the cza's correct explanation by bravais.  in order to produce artificial halos such as the tangent arcs or the circumscribed halo one should rotate a single columnar hexagonal crystal about 2 axes. similarly, the lowitz arcs can be created by rotating a single plate crystal about two axes. this can be done by engineered halo machines. the first such machine was constructed in 2003; several more followed. putting such machines inside spherical projection screens, and by the principle of the so-called sky transform, the analogy is nearly perfect. a realization using micro-versions of the aforementioned machines produces authentic distortion-free projections of such complex artificial halos. finally, superposition of several images and projections produced by such halo machines may be combined to create a single image. the resulting superposition image is then a representation of complex natural halo displays containing many different orientation sets of ice prisms.  the experimental reproduction of circular halos is the most difficult using a single crystal only, while it is the simplest and typically achieved one using chemical recipes. using a single crystal, one needs to realize all possible 3d orientations of the crystal. this has recently been achieved by two approaches. the first one using pneumatics and a sophisticated rigging, and a second one using an arduino-based random walk machine which stochastically reorients a crystal embedded in a transparent thin-walled sphere.","4, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3","3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4"

a “national museum ”, which presented the history of the european“ folk ” with a focus on german culture from pre-history until the then present day.","the museum of european cultures () - national museums in berlin - prussian cultural heritage foundation came from the unification of the europe-department in the berlin museum of ethnography and the berlin museum for folklore in 1999. the museum focuses on the lived-in world of europe and european culture contact, predominantly in germany from the 18th century until today.  the museum, together with the ethnological museum of berlin and the museum of asian art, is located in the dahlem museums. the building was named after the architect bruno paul (1874 – 1968) and is located in the modern district of steglitz-zehlendorf. the museum’s exhibition rooms occupy the oldest building in the dahlem museums.  the current museum of european cultures was established from several previous institutions which arose at the beginning of the 19th century and are due in part to private initiatives as well as governmental foundations.  the basis of the exhibit was two shaman drums of the northern european sámi which came to the königlich preußische kunstkammer (royal prussian art collection) at the beginning of the 19th century. in 1859 the neues museum opened which, among others, had an ethnological collection. this collection also held the “europa” cabinet, which surmises the nucleus of the current museum for european cultures.  the ethnological museum of the königlich preußischen museen (royal prussian museums) was institutionally founded in 1873. in 1886 the museum opened in a new building, which also contained european ethnographica, although no collections explicitly from germany.","the private initiative of the berliner physician, anthropologist, and politician rudolf virchow (1821-1902) and other members of the berliner anthropoligischen gesellschaft (berlin anthropological organization) led in 1889 to the founding and facilitation of the first germany-wide central “museum für deutsche volkstrachten und erzeugnisses des hausgewerbes” (museum for german traditional costumes and handicrafts). from 1891 the museum was financed through the museum association which was specifically established for this purpose. the goal of the museum was to give room to the cultural objects of their “own people” that had been excluded in ethnology as well as bordering, german-speaking lands. furthermore, the material goods from the country and farms, which in the wake of industrialization had begun to disappear, would be protected.  the private museum for german traditional costume and handicrafts, with the support of the patron james simon (1851-1932, from 1904 president of the museum’s association) and under the leadership of karl brunner (1904-1928), was in 1904 made part of the “königliche sammlung für deutsche volkskunde” (royal collection for german folklore), part of the königlich preußischen museen zu berlin. the institution would administratively shelter and take care of the prehistoric department of the museum for ethnology. due to the inexpedient incorporation of the department, the folklore collection there played only a marginal role.  first in 1929 an independent „staatliches museum für deutsche volkskunde“ (state museum for german folklore) was established. this museum was legally supported by the national museums of berlin. director konrad hahm (1928-1943) preoccupied himself with intensive public work, varying exhibits, and purposeful lectures so that the richness and variety of the museum’s collections could be made known to a large audience. on top of that, he compiled numerous memoirs and conceptions of various forms of the folklore performances in a central folklore museum. from 1934 until 1945 the museum for german folklore received its own building in the bellevue palace. the relocation of the exhibition and administration buildings to the prinzessinnenpalais (princess palace) next to the berlin state opera on unter den linden followed in 1938. the collections and workshops were moved as well into the former main building of the german freemasons in the splittgerbergasse. occasionally, the museum made concessions to the ruling ideology of national socialism. however, numerous exhibits coined from national socialism and large propaganda shows were not achieved.  konrad hahm dedicated himself to the founding of an “instituts für volkskunstforschung” (institute for folk art research) that under his guidance became associated with the berlin university in 1940. one of the museum affiliated branches, “schule und museum” (school and museum) appeared as early as 1939 in a museum pedagogic perspective. adolf reichwein, a progressive and humanistic educator and active resistance fighter in the kreisau circle, took over leadership until his arrest and later execution in october 1944.  with the establishment of a “eurasian” department in the museum for ethnology, whose institution was consistent with the national socialist ideology, the folklore collections had to give all of their “non-german” collection to the museum for ethnology. the museum, meanwhile, had to transfer all of their “german” objects to the museum for german folklore. thereby a new institutional separation occurred between the two fields. in world war ii, the museums lost numerous objects due to destruction, looting, and relocation to other places.  although the most valuable items of the museums’ collection were evacuated to nine different places in berlin, brandenburg, and vorpommern in the last years of the war, around 80% of the collection was destroyed. the objects from the berlin flak tower at the zoo that were brought to thuringia were carried from us garrisons back to wiesbaden. the soviet occupying forces transported the objects that remained at the flak tower as well as other valuable museum goods back to the soviet union in the summer of 1945.  the political separation of post-war germany led to the foundation of two parallel museums in berlin: a part of the collection was housed in the “museum für volkskunde” (museum for folklore) in the pergamon museum on the museum island, where after contextual-conceptual controversy it finally established itself with a new public collection. the other part in west berlin was shortly affiliated with the museum for ethnology, but won its autonomy in the framework of the prussian cultural heritage foundation as the “museum für deutsche volkskunde” (museum for german folklore) in 1963. even so, it was first in 1976 when the museum moved to the reopened warehouse wing of the prussian privy state archives in berlin-dahlem that it was accessible to the public. a ministerial dictate that forbid employees of the staatliche museen zu berlin (east) to have contact with institutions of the preußischen kulturbesitzes in berlin (west) was a crucial factor to the estrangement of both institutions.  in the 1980s both museums increasingly dedicated themselves to the cultural change from the industrial era right up to the life of the city dweller. with special exhibitions like “großstadtproletariat” (big city proletariat) (1980–87) or “dienstbare geister” (willing hands) (1981) the museums were able to overcome the confinements of the pre-industrial country and farm culture. the aspiration of the collection-politic to direct itself to modern dynamics was only partly fulfilled. after the cooperation between the european department of the museum for ethnology and the museum for german folklore, the idea came about in 1988 to found a “european museum” as a reaction to the social and cultural processes of change as part of the advanced political and economical european integration.  during the celebrations for the 100-year anniversary in 1989 of the museums for (german) folklore the latent contact between the two museums began to revive.  in connect to the political reunification of germany the collections of the state museums were brought together with the support of the prussian cultural heritage foundation. as part of the new orientation the separated museum inventories we initially unified into the “museum für volkskunde bei den staatlichen museen zu berlin/stiftung preußischer kulturbesitz” (museum for folklore by the national museums in berlin /prussian cultural heritage foundation). this complex organizational challenge triggered a wave of controversial contentual/conceptual discussions that entailed reconciling and compromising in regards to the prospective structure of the museum. the original idea from the museum for ethnology at the end of the

founding of the national museum“ ” that presented the history of european people 's“ ”, with an emphasis on the german culture from pre-history later today.","the museum of european cultures () - national museums in berlin - prussian cultural heritage foundation came from the unification of the europe-department in the berlin museum of ethnography and the berlin museum for folklore in 1999. the museum focuses on the lived-in world of europe and european culture contact, predominantly in germany from the 18th century until today.  the museum, together with the ethnological museum of berlin and the museum of asian art, is located in the dahlem museums. the building was named after the architect bruno paul (1874 – 1968) and is located in the modern district of steglitz-zehlendorf. the museum’s exhibition rooms occupy the oldest building in the dahlem museums.  the current museum of european cultures was established from several previous institutions which arose at the beginning of the 19th century and are due in part to private initiatives as well as governmental foundations.  the basis of the exhibit was two shaman drums of the northern european sámi which came to the königlich preußische kunstkammer (royal prussian art collection) at the beginning of the 19th century. in 1859 the neues museum opened which, among others, had an ethnological collection. this collection also held the “europa” cabinet, which surmises the nucleus of the current museum for european cultures.  the ethnological museum of the königlich preußischen museen (royal prussian museums) was institutionally founded in 1873. in 1886 the museum opened in a new building, which also contained european ethnographica, although no collections explicitly from germany.","the private initiative of the berliner physician, anthropologist, and politician rudolf virchow (1821-1902) and other members of the berliner anthropoligischen gesellschaft (berlin anthropological organization) led in 1889 to the founding and facilitation of the first germany-wide central “museum für deutsche volkstrachten und erzeugnisses des hausgewerbes” (museum for german traditional costumes and handicrafts). from 1891 the museum was financed through the museum association which was specifically established for this purpose. the goal of the museum was to give room to the cultural objects of their “own people” that had been excluded in ethnology as well as bordering, german-speaking lands. furthermore, the material goods from the country and farms, which in the wake of industrialization had begun to disappear, would be protected.  the private museum for german traditional costume and handicrafts, with the support of the patron james simon (1851-1932, from 1904 president of the museum’s association) and under the leadership of karl brunner (1904-1928), was in 1904 made part of the “königliche sammlung für deutsche volkskunde” (royal collection for german folklore), part of the königlich preußischen museen zu berlin. the institution would administratively shelter and take care of the prehistoric department of the museum for ethnology. due to the inexpedient incorporation of the department, the folklore collection there played only a marginal role.  first in 1929 an independent „staatliches museum für deutsche volkskunde“ (state museum for german folklore) was established. this museum was legally supported by the national museums of berlin. director konrad hahm (1928-1943) preoccupied himself with intensive public work, varying exhibits, and purposeful lectures so that the richness and variety of the museum’s collections could be made known to a large audience. on top of that, he compiled numerous memoirs and conceptions of various forms of the folklore performances in a central folklore museum. from 1934 until 1945 the museum for german folklore received its own building in the bellevue palace. the relocation of the exhibition and administration buildings to the prinzessinnenpalais (princess palace) next to the berlin state opera on unter den linden followed in 1938. the collections and workshops were moved as well into the former main building of the german freemasons in the splittgerbergasse. occasionally, the museum made concessions to the ruling ideology of national socialism. however, numerous exhibits coined from national socialism and large propaganda shows were not achieved.  konrad hahm dedicated himself to the founding of an “instituts für volkskunstforschung” (institute for folk art research) that under his guidance became associated with the berlin university in 1940. one of the museum affiliated branches, “schule und museum” (school and museum) appeared as early as 1939 in a museum pedagogic perspective. adolf reichwein, a progressive and humanistic educator and active resistance fighter in the kreisau circle, took over leadership until his arrest and later execution in october 1944.  with the establishment of a “eurasian” department in the museum for ethnology, whose institution was consistent with the national socialist ideology, the folklore collections had to give all of their “non-german” collection to the museum for ethnology. the museum, meanwhile, had to transfer all of their “german” objects to the museum for german folklore. thereby a new institutional separation occurred between the two fields. in world war ii, the museums lost numerous objects due to destruction, looting, and relocation to other places.  although the most valuable items of the museums’ collection were evacuated to nine different places in berlin, brandenburg, and vorpommern in the last years of the war, around 80% of the collection was destroyed. the objects from the berlin flak tower at the zoo that were brought to thuringia were carried from us garrisons back to wiesbaden. the soviet occupying forces transported the objects that remained at the flak tower as well as other valuable museum goods back to the soviet union in the summer of 1945.  the political separation of post-war germany led to the foundation of two parallel museums in berlin: a part of the collection was housed in the “museum für volkskunde” (museum for folklore) in the pergamon museum on the museum island, where after contextual-conceptual controversy it finally established itself with a new public collection. the other part in west berlin was shortly affiliated with the museum for ethnology, but won its autonomy in the framework of the prussian cultural heritage foundation as the “museum für deutsche volkskunde” (museum for german folklore) in 1963. even so, it was first in 1976 when the museum moved to the reopened warehouse wing of the prussian privy state archives in berlin-dahlem that it was accessible to the public. a ministerial dictate that forbid employees of the staatliche museen zu berlin (east) to have contact with institutions of the preußischen kulturbesitzes in berlin (west) was a crucial factor to the estrangement of both institutions.  in the 1980s both museums increasingly dedicated themselves to the cultural change from the industrial era right up to the life of the city dweller. with special exhibitions like “großstadtproletariat” (big city proletariat) (1980–87) or “dienstbare geister” (willing hands) (1981) the museums were able to overcome the confinements of the pre-industrial country and farm culture. the aspiration of the collection-politic to direct itself to modern dynamics was only partly fulfilled. after the cooperation between the european department of the museum for ethnology and the museum for german folklore, the idea came about in 1988 to found a “european museum” as a reaction to the social and cultural processes of change as part of the advanced political and economical european integration.  during the celebrations for the 100-year anniversary in 1989 of the museums for (german) folklore the latent contact between the two museums began to revive.  in connect to the political reunification of germany the collections of the state museums were brought together with the support of the prussian cultural heritage foundation. as part of the new orientation the separated museum inventories we initially unified into the “museum für volkskunde bei den staatlichen museen zu berlin/stiftung preußischer kulturbesitz” (museum for folklore by the national museums in berlin /prussian cultural heritage foundation). this complex organizational challenge triggered a wave of controversial contentual/conceptual discussions that entailed reconciling and compromising in regards to the prospective structure of the museum. the original idea from the museum for ethnology at the end of the

humanistic educator and active resistance fighter in the kreisau circle, took over leadership until his arrest and later execution in october 1944.  with the establishment of a “eurasian” department in the museum for ethnology, whose institution was consistent with the national socialist ideology, the folklore collections had to give all of their “non-german” collection to the museum for ethnology. the museum, meanwhile, had to transfer all of their “german” objects to the museum for german folklore. thereby a new institutional separation occurred between the two fields. in world war ii, the museums lost numerous objects due to destruction, looting, and relocation to other places.  although the most valuable items of the museums’ collection were evacuated to nine different places in berlin, brandenburg, and vorpommern in the last years of the war, around 80% of the collection was destroyed. the objects from the berlin flak tower at the zoo that were brought to thuringia were carried from us garrisons back to wiesbaden. the soviet occupying forces transported the objects that remained at the flak tower as well as other valuable museum goods back to the soviet union in the summer of 1945.  the political separation of post-war germany led to the foundation of two parallel museums in berlin: a part of the collection was housed in the “museum für volkskunde” (museum for folklore) in the pergamon museum on the museum island, where after contextual-conceptual controversy it finally established itself with a new public collection. the other part in west berlin was shortly affiliated with the museum for ethnology, but won its autonomy in the framework of the prussian cultural heritage foundation as the “museum für deutsche volkskunde” (museum for german folklore) in 1963. even so, it was first in 1976 when the museum moved to the reopened warehouse wing of the prussian privy state archives in berlin-dahlem that it was accessible to the public. a ministerial dictate that forbid employees of the staatliche museen zu berlin (east) to have contact with institutions of the preußischen kulturbesitzes in berlin (west) was a crucial factor to the estrangement of both institutions.  in the 1980s both museums increasingly dedicated themselves to the cultural change from the industrial era right up to the life of the city dweller. with special exhibitions like “großstadtproletariat” (big city proletariat) (1980–87) or “dienstbare geister” (willing hands) (1981) the museums were able to overcome the confinements of the pre-industrial country and farm culture. the aspiration of the collection-politic to direct itself to modern dynamics was only partly fulfilled. after the cooperation between the european department of the museum for ethnology and the museum for german folklore, the idea came about in 1988 to found a “european museum” as a reaction to the social and cultural processes of change as part of the advanced political and economical european integration.  during the celebrations for the 100-year anniversary in 1989 of the museums for (german) folklore the latent contact between the two museums began to revive.  in connect to the political reunification of germany the collections of the state museums were brought together with the support of the prussian cultural heritage foundation. as part of the new orientation the separated museum inventories we initially unified into the “museum für volkskunde bei den staatlichen museen zu berlin/stiftung preußischer kulturbesitz” (museum for folklore by the national museums in berlin /prussian cultural heritage foundation). this complex organizational challenge triggered a wave of controversial contentual/conceptual discussions that entailed reconciling and compromising in regards to the prospective structure of the museum. the original idea from the museum for ethnology at the end of the 1980s for a new concept of a museum with a european direction was elaborated: the europe department and the museum for folklore would be consolidated into one new museum.  as a result, the museum of european cultures, with its new programmatic direction, was founded in 1999. this new founding took into account the present societal, political, and cultural developments in europe. the museum explored historical, cultural, and nationalistic borders between the “us” and the purportedly foreign “them”. the museum also documented and collected, within european context, international exchange processes of the every day life of european societies and its accompanying changes. at the same time the museum busies itself with issues of the plural society in germany, such as migrant movements, cultural diversity, its expression and societal effects, especially in urban settings.  the museum moved its exhibits to the dahlem museums in 2011 in the bruno-paul building in arnimallee 25. the workshops, warehouse, and employee offices can still be

modern xingtai, hebei). as a child he came to live with his aunt — a younger sister of his father chai shouli (柴守禮) — and her husband guo wei, an official in the later tang military. the guos had no sons, so they adopted the quiet nephew as their own. the youngster grew up into a muscular young man skilled at mounted archery, while also possessing a basic understanding of chinese classics, history, and the huang-lao philosophy.  after the establishment of the later han in 947, the guo family's condition improved dramatically. guo wei became the commissioner of military affairs (樞密使) in 948, and his adopted son became the left commandant for palace-gate security (左堅門衛將軍). on 4 may 950, guo was promoted to military governor of tianxiong command (天雄軍) and delegated to garrison at weizhou (魏州; modern linzhang county, hebei) at the later han-liao dynasty border to prevent a possible liao incursion. ten days later, his adopted son was appointed tianxiong command's chief director of military headquarters (牙內都指揮使) to follow him in weizhou. chai rong — by now known as guo rong — was also given a nominal post of prefect of guizhou (貴州).  in 950, the later han emperor liu chengyou unexpectedly killed the entire family of guo wei as a plot to liquidate the most powerful ministers in his nation. guo wei decided to rebel. as guo rong's wife lady liu (劉氏) and children including 3 young sons also remained in the capital bianzhou (汴州; today's kaifeng, henan), they were all slaughtered as well. guo wei asked guo rong to stay behind at the frontier as he led his main army southbound towards bianzhou.  in a few months, liu chengyou was killed, later han was terminated, as guo wei founded the later zhou. guo rong became the military governor of zhenning command (鎮寧軍) and went to chanzhou (澶州;

51,English,volunteers are encouraged to participate in recovery efforts arranged by conservation volunteers as part of the wild futures program.,"the eastern barred bandicoot (""perameles gunnii"") is a small, rabbit-sized marsupial native to tasmania and victoria, southeastern australia. it is one of three extant bandicoot species in the genus ""perameles"".  the eastern barred bandicoot weighs less than and has a short tail and three to four whitish bars across the rump. the eastern barred bandicoot has two separated populations, one on the mainland of australia and one on the island of tasmania. the tasmanian form is somewhat larger than the mainland form as the average adult mass is 750 g in victoria and 1,000 g in tasmania. it lives for just two to three years and is not gregarious. males occupy large home ranges compared to females and only consort with females for mating. this species is nocturnal. it emerges from its nest at dusk to forage for a variety of invertebrates including crickets, beetles and earthworms. during the day it rests in a grass-lined nest. when foraging, it uses its long nose to probe deep into the soil and then digs eagerly when it locates food. females have 8 nipples and can produce a maximum of 5 young in one litter with an average of 2 to 3 young. gestation lasts just 12 days—this is one of the shortest gestation periods of any mammal. young are weaned at 55 days and emerged juveniles remain dependent upon the mother and forage with her until day 86. given ideal conditions, females can have up to five litters per year although reproduction becomes depressed in summer and ceases altogether in times of drought.  the eastern barred bandicoot was once distributed across the basalt plains of south west victoria, and in tasmania. due to predation by introduced foxes and cats, along with land-clearing for farming practices, the victorian subspecies is critically endangered. since 1989, eight reintroduction sites have been established across the bandicoot's former range. the conservation of eastern barred bandicoots in victoria now depends upon the success of captive breeding and reintroduction programs. keys to this conservation plan include maintaining an insurance population in captivity, conducting research to improve breeding and reintroduction success and increasing community awareness and support for this rare marsupial. a management plan, developed in 1987 and revised in 1989, recommended the first reintroduction of the eastern barred bandicoot in victoria at woodlands historic park, 20 km northwest of melbourne. animals were translocated from the last remaining free-ranging mainland population in hamilton, western victoria to captive breeding facilities at woodlands to establish a population in 1988. the captive-bred offspring formed the basis for reintroductions into the nature reserve, known as the back paddock, a 400-ha section of the park with a predator-resistant fence to keep out feral predators. unfortunately, populations at four sites are now extinct (floating islands nature reserve, lanark, cobra killuc wildlife reserve and lake goldsmith nature reserve), functionally extinct at woodlands historic park, declining at mooramong and increasing at hamilton community parklands and mount rothwell. the last remaining wild population which was once found along the grange burn (a creek) in hamilton has also been declared extinct. the estimated population size for the victorian eastern barred bandicoot is 150 individuals. the tasmanian subspecies (""p. g. gunni"") is vulnerable to extinction. this species is more widespread than its mainland cousin because tasmania provides large areas of suitable habitat and because the island lacks the bandicoot's main predator, the red fox.  in the state of victoria, a recovery team oversees actions aimed at conserving the victorian subspecies. representatives of government agencies, ngos and private conservation groups collaborate to develop and implement actions to improve the species' outlook. groups include conservation volunteers, zoos victoria, parks victoria www.parkweb.vic.gov.au, mount rothwell biodiversity interpretation centre, university of melbourne, conservation enterprises unlimited, national trust of australia (victoria) and department of sustainability and environment.","an effective recovery tactic currently in use is the exclusion of invasive predators from populations of threatened eastern barred bandicoots through the extensive use of conservation fences. non-native predator species that are fenced out from endangered populations include feral cats and red foxes. another important feature of conservation fences are that they restrict the spread of infectious diseases among the few remaining animals.  the eastern barred bandicoot is most closely related to the other species of bandicoot in its genus, of which only two species are still extant today. these surviving relatives are the western barred bandicoot (""p. bougainville"") and the long-nosed bandicoot (""p. nastua""). it is also closely related to the desert bandicoot of the same genus, but this species has become extinct. there are about 20 other bandicoots in the same family, peramelidae. they share similar features of long pointed snouts, and small ears. the bandicoots are closely related to the bilbies, which share the same order, peramelemorphia. these are all from the infraclass marsupialia, shared of course with other species such as koalas and kangaroos, which means they diverged from the other placental mammals about 100 million years ago.  all the species of this order are native to australia and new guinea; however it is unclear how closely related this order is to the rest of the marsupials. the bandicoots have two features that suggest separate and quite opposite ideas of their evolution. they have three pairs of lower front incisors, which would usually suggest evolution from the order dasyuromorphia, which consists of carnivorous marsupials; however, the bandicoot's middle two digits are syndactylous, meaning they are joined together except for the claw. this would suggest they share the common ancestor of the diprotodontia which includes the kangaroos and koalas.  there are, of course, theories using these features to describe their evolution. the incisors could, in fact, be analogous features shared between the bandicoot and the order dasyuromorphia. they share the same function, after all, and though they are structurally similar the incisors of the carnivorous marsupials are a lot sharper than the flatter versions in the bandicoot. the bandicoot may have evolved the third tooth separately. if this was the case, it would seem logical that the syndactyl feet were homologous features shared between the bandicoots and the kangaroos, wombats, possums and other species. this would make sense as syndactyly is so rare it is unlikely that it would evolve twice in two separate populations. the feet of the bandicoot when compared to, say, the kangaroo are structurally quite similar. this similarity suggests that the bandicoots share a more recent ancestor with them.  nevertheless, though this idea is more likely, simply because of the rarity of syndactyly, it is possible that syndactyly evolved in the two different populations, and that bandicoots are actually more closely related to species such as the tasmanian devil and the numbat. this would mean the incisors were homologous features, structurally the same but with a slightly different function (as the carnivorous marsupials use them to rip through flesh), and the syndactyl hind feet are analogous features, as they are used for the same basic function but are not evidence of divergent evolution.  current molecular evidence does not support or disprove any of these theories, or any other related theories that are not suggested here. it is not quite definitive where the bandicoot sits exactly in the tree of life, but whatever the case, it seems that the relationship between the bandicoots and bilbies with the other orders is a distant one.","3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,

this conservation plan include maintaining an insurance population in captivity, conducting research to improve breeding and reintroduction success and increasing community awareness and support for this rare marsupial. a management plan, developed in 1987 and revised in 1989, recommended the first reintroduction of the eastern barred bandicoot in victoria at woodlands historic park, 20 km northwest of melbourne. animals were translocated from the last remaining free-ranging mainland population in hamilton, western victoria to captive breeding facilities at woodlands to establish a population in 1988. the captive-bred offspring formed the basis for reintroductions into the nature reserve, known as the back paddock, a 400-ha section of the park with a predator-resistant fence to keep out feral predators. unfortunately, populations at four sites are now extinct (floating islands nature reserve, lanark, cobra killuc wildlife reserve and lake goldsmith nature reserve), functionally extinct at woodlands historic park, declining at mooramong and increasing at hamilton community parklands and mount rothwell. the last remaining wild population which was once found along the grange burn (a creek) in hamilton has also been declared extinct. the estimated population size for the victorian eastern barred bandicoot is 150 individuals. the tasmanian subspecies (""p. g. gunni"") is vulnerable to extinction. this species is more widespread than its mainland cousin because tasmania provides large areas of suitable habitat and because the island lacks the bandicoot's main predator, the red fox.  in the state of victoria, a recovery team oversees actions aimed at conserving the victorian subspecies. representatives of government agencies, ngos and private conservation groups collaborate to develop and implement actions to improve the species' outlook. groups include conservation volunteers, zoos victoria, parks victoria www.parkweb.vic.gov.au, mount rothwell biodiversity interpretation centre, university of melbourne, conservation enterprises unlimited, national trust of australia (victoria) and department of sustainability and environment.","an effective recovery tactic currently in use is the exclusion of invasive predators from populations of threatened eastern barred bandicoots through the extensive use of conservation fences. non-native predator species that are fenced out from endangered populations include feral cats and red foxes. another important feature of conservation fences are that they restrict the spread of infectious diseases among the few remaining animals.  the eastern barred bandicoot is most closely related to the other species of bandicoot in its genus, of which only two species are still extant today. these surviving relatives are the western barred bandicoot (""p. bougainville"") and the long-nosed bandicoot (""p. nastua""). it is also closely related to the desert bandicoot of the same genus, but this species has become extinct. there are about 20 other bandicoots in the same family, peramelidae. they share similar features of long pointed snouts, and small ears. the bandicoots are closely related to the bilbies, which share the same order, peramelemorphia. these are all from the infraclass marsupialia, shared of course with other species such as koalas and kangaroos, which means they diverged from the other placental mammals about 100 million years ago.  all the species of this order are native to australia and new guinea; however it is unclear how closely related this order is to the rest of the marsupials. the bandicoots have two features that suggest separate and quite opposite ideas of their evolution. they have three pairs of lower front incisors, which would usually suggest evolution from the order dasyuromorphia, which consists of carnivorous marsupials; however, the bandicoot's middle two digits are syndactylous, meaning they are joined together except for the claw. this would suggest they share the common ancestor of the diprotodontia which includes the kangaroos and koalas.  there are, of course, theories using these features to describe their evolution. the incisors could, in fact, be analogous features shared between the bandicoot and the order dasyuromorphia. they share the same function, after all, and though they are structurally similar the incisors of the carnivorous marsupials are a lot sharper than the flatter versions in the bandicoot. the bandicoot may have evolved the third tooth separately. if this was the case, it would seem logical that the syndactyl feet were homologous features shared between the bandicoots and the kangaroos, wombats, possums and other species. this would make sense as syndactyly is so rare it is unlikely that it would evolve twice in two separate populations. the feet of the bandicoot when compared to, say, the kangaroo are structurally quite similar. this similarity suggests that the bandicoots share a more recent ancestor with them.  nevertheless, though this idea is more likely, simply because of the rarity of syndactyly, it is possible that syndactyly evolved in the two different populations, and that bandicoots are actually more closely related to species such as the tasmanian devil and the numbat. this would mean the incisors were homologous features, structurally the same but with a slightly different function (as the carnivorous marsupials use them to rip through flesh), and the syndactyl hind feet are analogous features, as they are used for the same basic function but are not evidence of divergent evolution.  current molecular evidence does not support or disprove any of these theories, or any other related theories that are not suggested here. it is not quite definitive where the bandicoot sits exactly in the tree of life, but whatever the case, it seems that the relationship between the bandicoots and bilbies with the other orders is a distant one.","4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4,

51,French,volunteers are encouraged to participate to the effort to replenish held by volunteers in the framework of the programme in the wild.,"the eastern barred bandicoot (""perameles gunnii"") is a small, rabbit-sized marsupial native to tasmania and victoria, southeastern australia. it is one of three extant bandicoot species in the genus ""perameles"".  the eastern barred bandicoot weighs less than and has a short tail and three to four whitish bars across the rump. the eastern barred bandicoot has two separated populations, one on the mainland of australia and one on the island of tasmania. the tasmanian form is somewhat larger than the mainland form as the average adult mass is 750 g in victoria and 1,000 g in tasmania. it lives for just two to three years and is not gregarious. males occupy large home ranges compared to females and only consort with females for mating. this species is nocturnal. it emerges from its nest at dusk to forage for a variety of invertebrates including crickets, beetles and earthworms. during the day it rests in a grass-lined nest. when foraging, it uses its long nose to probe deep into the soil and then digs eagerly when it locates food. females have 8 nipples and can produce a maximum of 5 young in one litter with an average of 2 to 3 young. gestation lasts just 12 days—this is one of the shortest gestation periods of any mammal. young are weaned at 55 days and emerged juveniles remain dependent upon the mother and forage with her until day 86. given ideal conditions, females can have up to five litters per year although reproduction becomes depressed in summer and ceases altogether in times of drought.  the eastern barred bandicoot was once distributed across the basalt plains of south west victoria, and in

55,English,"according to the medieval swedish ballad stolt herr alf, odin himself advised a king to kill one of his vassals with quickfire.","arson in medieval scandinavia (old norse ""hús-brenna ""or ""hús-bruni, """"house-burning"") was a technique sometimes employed in blood feuds and political conflicts in order to assassinate someone. in committing arson, a group of attackers would set fire to the home of an opponent, sometimes by quickly and surreptitiously piling wood, brush and other combustible materials against the exterior of a dwelling and set it on fire. typically the attackers would surround the house to prevent the escape of its inhabitants, although women, the elderly, and small children were sometimes allowed to leave.  under icelandic law as codified in the gragas, quickfire could be punished by death only if the arsonists were killed in the act. however, if captured alive the arsonists had to be tried and sentenced to outlawry, even if they were ""thralls"". failure to observe these formalities could result in the killer of quickfire-arsonists being prosecuted himself. at least some icelanders considered quickfire dishonorable, hence when the enemies of gunnar hámundarson attacked his home they refused to burn him inside, despite the fact that it would have been faster and less costly in lives. members of gunnar's clan showed no such scruples when, around 1010, they burned bergthorshvoll, home of gunnar's erstwhile ally njáll þorgeirsson, his wife bergþóra, his sons helgi and skarphéðinn njálsson, and his grandson þórður kárason. it is because of this occurrence of quickfire that the name of the saga in icelandic is ""brennu-njáls saga"", ""the saga of the burning of njáll"". one son-in-law, kári sölmundarson, escaped and later killed many of the burners. here is the description of the arson of njáll's house : another instance of quickfire is told in the ""eyrbyggja saga"". according to it, in the late 10th century in iceland, ulfar, a freedman, was the victim of an attempted quickfire by thralls (slaves, or serfs) owned by his enemy thorolf. thorolf's own son, arnkel goði, captured the thralls in the act and had them executed the following day. arnkel's rival snorri goði prosecuted arnkel, at thorolf's request, for the unlawful killing of the thralls.  the ""sturlunga saga"" reports that in 1253, during the age of the

space station (iss), the other being the russian orlan space suit. it was used by nasa's space shuttle astronauts prior to the end of the shuttle program in 2011.  the emu, like the apollo/skylab a7l spacesuit, was the result of years of research and development. it consists of a hard upper torso (hut) assembly, a primary life support system (plss) which incorporates the life support and electrical systems, arm sections, gloves, an apollo-style ""bubble"" helmet, the extravehicular visor assembly (evva), and a soft lower torso assembly (lta), incorporating the body seal closure (bsc), waist bearing, brief, legs, and boots. prior to donning the pressure garment, the crew member puts on a maximum absorbency garment (mag) (basically a modified incontinence diaper – urine collection devices (ucds) are no longer used), and possibly a thermal control undergarment (long johns). the final item donned before putting on the pressure suit is the liquid cooling and ventilation garment (lcvg), which incorporates clear plastic tubing through which chilled liquid water flows for body temperature control, as well as ventilation tubes for waste gas removal.  after donning the lcvg, the astronaut then puts on the lta, before entering the airlock. the astronaut then dons the hut, connects the lcvg umbilical to the umbilical in the hut, and then locks the two parts of the suit together using the body seal closure. once the suit is turned on and checked out, the astronaut dons a ""snoopy cap"", a brown and white fabric communications cap dating back to the apollo days, which incorporates a pair of earphones and microphones, allowing the eva astronaut to communicate with both the crew members in the orbiter and ground controllers in houston. after donning the ""snoopy cap"", the gloves and helmet are then locked on, pressurizing the suit. the suit's regulator and fans activate when the servicing umbilicals are removed and the suit reaches an internal pressure of . a typical emu can support an astronaut for 8.5 hours, including 30 minutes of reserves in the case of primary life support failure. to perform an eva from the shuttle, the cabin pressure was reduced from 14.7 psi to 10.2 psi for 24 hours, after which an astronaut had to pre-breathe for 45 minutes. for evas on board the iss, the astronaut must pre-breathe for about four hours.  manufacturer: ilc

two companies, who were rivals during the early days of apollo for the contract to build the ""block ii"" (moonwalking) space suit, teamed up in 1974 against the david clark company and garrett airesearch for the emu development and construction. during apollo, the ilc dover-produced a7l used the life support backpack, helmet, and locking rings supplied by hamilton united, but originally, ilc dover was to just supply the arms and legs of the suit, a similar process that is still going on today.  upon receiving the contract to build the emu in 1974, hamilton united and ilc dover delivered the first emu units to nasa in 1982. during the research and development phase (1975–1980), a suit being tested caught fire, injuring a technician and forcing a redesign on the regulator and circulation fan. on sts-4 in july 1982, the astronauts practiced donning and doffing the suit in the shuttle's airlock. the first shuttle eva was to occur on sts-5, but an electrical failure on the circulation fan forced the eva to be cancelled. the first eva of the new emu finally occurred on sts-6 when story musgrave and donald peterson went out in the payload bay of the space shuttle challenger and tested techniques to lower the launch cradle of a solid-fuel upper stage used to boost a tracking and data relay satellite (tdrs-a) into a geo-stationary orbit.  other evas followed on

nasa to fly four sets of suits (along with repair parts). 41 evas using emus had been conducted out of the space shuttle airlock prior to the start of iss assembly in november 1998.  with the building

58,French,"the mobility extravehicular (emu) is an independent unit anthropomorphic spacesuit that provides for the protection of the environment, mobility, life support, and communications to astronauts performing extra-vehicular activity (eva) into orbit land.",,"introduced in 1981, it is a two-piece semi-rigid suit, and is currently one of two eva spacesuits used by crew members on the international space station (iss), the other being the russian orlan space suit. it was used by nasa's space shuttle astronauts prior to the end of the shuttle program in 2011.  the emu, like the apollo/skylab a7l spacesuit, was the result of years of research and development. it consists of a hard upper torso (hut) assembly, a primary life support system (plss) which incorporates the life support and electrical systems, arm sections, gloves, an apollo-style ""bubble"" helmet, the extravehicular visor assembly (evva), and a soft lower torso assembly (lta), incorporating the body seal closure (bsc), waist bearing, brief, legs, and boots. prior to donning the pressure garment, the crew member puts on a maximum absorbency garment (mag) (basically a modified incontinence diaper – urine collection devices (ucds) are no longer used), and possibly a thermal control undergarment (long johns). the final item donned before putting on the pressure suit is the liquid cooling and ventilation garment (lcvg), which incorporates clear plastic tubing through which chilled liquid water flows for body temperature control, as well as ventilation tubes for waste gas removal.  after donning the lcvg, the astronaut then puts on the lta, before entering the airlock. the astronaut then dons the hut, connects the lcvg umbilical to the umbilical in the hut, and then locks the two parts of the suit together using the body seal closure. once the suit is turned on and checked out, the astronaut dons a ""snoopy cap"", a brown and white fabric communications cap dating back to the apollo days, which incorporates a pair of earphones and microphones, allowing the eva astronaut to communicate with both the crew members in the orbiter and ground controllers in houston. after donning the ""snoopy cap"", the gloves and helmet are then locked on, pressurizing the suit. the suit's regulator and fans activate when the servicing umbilicals are removed and the suit reaches an

""ad hominem tu quoque"" (literally: ""you also"") refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument. in particular, if source a criticizes the actions of source b, a ""tu quoque"" response is that source a has acted in the same way. this argument is false because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true then source a may be a hypocrite, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. indeed, source a may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.  for example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. this does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.","it constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. this is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument false; this overlaps with the genetic fallacy (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).  the circumstantial fallacy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted. where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.  examples:   guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ""ad hominem"" fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.  this form of the argument is as follows:  an example of this fallacy could be ""my opponent for office just received an endorsement from the puppy haters association. is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?""  when a statement is challenged by making an ""ad hominem"" attack on its author, it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was ""an argument"" or ""a statement of fact"" (""testimony""). in the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.  doug walton, canadian academic and author, has argued that ""ad hominem"" reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue, as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.  the philosopher charles taylor has argued that ""ad hominem"" reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the apodictic reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.","2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2","3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3"

(named after sir thomas sopwith's home of horsley towers) was originally designed to meet air ministry specification 26/23 for a day bomber powered by a single rolls-royce condor engine. while the specification called for any production aircraft to be of metal construction, hawker proposed to build the prototype of wooden construction, gradually switching to a metal structure during production. this was acceptable to the air ministry, and an order for a single prototype was placed. the first prototype was flown in march 1925, powered by a 650 hp (485 kw) condor iii engine, and was delivered to the aeroplane and armament experimental establishment at martlesham heath on 4 may 1925.  meanwhile, the air ministry revised its requirements, producing specification 23/25 which increased the required payload from one to two 551 lb (250 kg) bombs. at the same time, it also issued specification 24/25 for a torpedo bomber, required to carry a 2,150 lb (975 kg) torpedo. the horsley's ability to cope with the increased loads required to meet these new specifications led to the design being favoured by the raf, with an initial order of forty aircraft, consisting of ten wooden mk is and 30 mk iis of mixed metal and wood construction, being placed.  the horsley was a large single-engined two-bay biplane. it had a crew of two, comprising a pilot and a gunner/bomb-aimer/radio operator, who had a .303 in (7.7 mm) lewis gun mounted in a scarff ring in the rear cockpit and a prone position for bomb aiming. the rear cockpit was also fitted with dual controls. the payload included two 551 lb (250 kg) bombs, one 1,500 lb (680 kg) bomb or a torpedo weighing 2,800 lb (1,270 kg).  the structure was originally all wood, but before production was complete an all-metal structure was introduced, made in what became the famous hawker system of metal construction. the three methods of construction were designated: horsley mk i for the all-wooden aircraft, horsley mk ii for the mixed material, and (unofficially) horsley iii for the all-metal aircraft. some aircraft were fitted with floats.  two aircraft, known as the hawker dantorp and powered by leopard ii engines were sold to the danish government. they had a slightly different fuselage, accommodating a third crew member. the danes also purchased a licence to build a further ten aircraft at the danish naval workshops (orlogsvaerftet), but these were not built owing to a shortage of funds.  production aircraft were powered by the condor iiia, but the horsley was also much used as a flying testbed for other engines,

aircraft were delivered to no 100 (bomber) squadron of the royal air force in september 1927, with two more squadrons, no. 15 and no. 11 squadrons receiving horsleys by the end of the year, replacing

beaten in turn within a few hours by charles lindbergh, whose solo atlantic flight between new york and paris in the ""spirit of st. louis"" covered 3,590 mi (5,780 km).  the horsleys remained in service in the day-bombing role until 1934, with 504 squadron's horsleys being replaced by westland wallaces in march 1934. no 36 squadron at singapore retained the horsely in the torpedo bomber role until july 1935. the last horsley, a merlin-powered testbed flew its final flight at rae farnborough on 7 march 1938.  a total of 124 horsleys were built, including six aircraft for the hellenic naval

80,English,"since the days of the delhi sultanate, the city of delhi had acquired the reputation of being the political centre of india.","the battle of tughlaqabad (also known as the battle of delhi) was a notable battle fought on 7 october 1556 between hemu, the general and chief minister of adil shah suri, and the forces of the mughal led by tardi beg khan at tughlaqabad near delhi. the battle ended in a decisive victory for hemu who took possession of delhi and claimed royal status, assuming the title of raja vikramaditya. following his failure, tardi beg was murdered by akbar's regent, bairam khan. the two armies would meet again at panipat a month later.","no ruler could be considered to truly hold sway over ""hindustan"" until he had control of delhi. babur, the founder of the mughal empire, called it the ""capital of all hindustan"", and his son and successor, humayun, constructed his din panah at its outskirts. humayun, however, lost his inheritance when he was chased out of india by sher shah suri who established the sur empire in 1540. delhi and agra fell into sher shah's hands and he razed din panah and built his new capital, sher shahabad, at the same site.  sher shah died soon after in 1545 at kalinjar. he was succeeded by his younger son, islam shah suri, who was a capable ruler. however, upon his death in 1553, the sur empire was caught up in a succession battle and was plagued by rebellion and the secession of provinces. humayun made use of this discord to recapture what was lost and on 23 july 1555, the mughals defeated sikandar shah suri and finally regained control over delhi and agra.  islam shah's rightful successor, his 12-year-old son, firoz khan, had been murdered by his maternal uncle who had taken the throne as adil shah suri. the new ruler was however, more interested in the pursuit of pleasure than in the affairs of his state. those were largely left to hemu, a hindu from rewari, who had risen from humble circumstances to become both adil shah's chief minister as well as the general of the suri army. he was in bengal when humayun died on 26 january 1556. the mughal emperor's death provided an ideal opportunity to defeat the mughals and reclaim lost territory.  hemu started a rapid march from the eastern provinces and drove the mughals out of bayana, etawah, sambhal, kalpi, and narnaul. in agra, the governor evacuated the city and fled without a fight upon hearing of hemu's impending invasion.  tardi beg khan, who was humayun's successor, akbar's governor in delhi wrote to his masters who were camped at jalandhar, that

""sphinx"" was paid off at spithead on 7 november 1754. jervis was assigned to the 20-gun in december of the same year and then from the end of december until february 1755 was assigned to hm yacht ""william and mary"" under the navigational expert captain john campbell.  jervis passed his lieutenant's examination on 2 january 1755 and was assigned as sixth lieutenant to the first-rate of 100 guns. by march, he had moved to third lieutenant of the 60-gun . the ""nottingham"" was part of edward boscawen's fleet that attempted to prevent french reinforcements reaching new france. on 31 march 1756 jervis moved to the 74-gun hms and on 22 june he was promoted to be fourth lieutenant of the 90-gun ""prince"" under captain charles saunders in the mediterranean. when the captain was promoted to admiral, jervis followed him to the 74-gun in november 1756. in january 1757 jervis was promoted to temporary command of . in her, he fought a large french privateer in an indecisive action off cape gata. when the captain of the ""experiment"" regained his health jervis moved back to the ""culloden"". in june 1757, he followed saunders to the 90-gun hms ""st george"". jervis returned to england in temporary command of the 80-gun , a ship that had been captured by henry osborn's fleet at the battle of cartagena. he followed saunders once more when the admiral was promoted to command the north american station; jervis was promoted to lieutenant of hms ""prince"".  the fleet, part of an expedition to capture the french possessions in north america, left england in february 1759. they stopped first at louisbourg, which had been captured from the french the previous year. by june, the ice along the saint lawrence river had broken up and the fleet along with the military transports headed up river to the assault of quebec city. on 15 may 1759, jervis had been promoted acting commander of the sloop . in this command jervis impressed general james wolfe in the preparations that led to the battle of the plains of abraham. ""porcupine"" and the frigate led the armed transports past quebec to land up river. one biographer, jedediah tucker, notes that as the approach was so critical, both wolfe and the subsequently famous james cook boarded the ""porcupine"" to ensure the success of the mission.  for his efforts jervis was promoted commander and took command of . jervis returned to england in september but immediately returned to north america in command of the ""albany"". in may 1760 jervis was attached to admiral sir george rodney's channel squadron.  in october 1760 he was made post-captain in command of the 44-gun . ""gosport"" had on board a young midshipman, george elphinstone, later viscount keith, who took over jervis' command in the mediterranean after jervis' departure in 1799. in 1762, hms ""gosport"", and under captain joshua rowley, convoyed the east and west indian trade to the westward, and successfully protected it from the squadron of commodore de ternay.","he was tasked with delivering bullion to the english merchants in genoa. during his time in genoa two turkish slaves escaped a genoese galley and hid aboard one of ""alarm"" boats. they were forcibly removed; jervis made an official protest and promised retaliation if they were not handed over. the slaves were produced and jervis took custody of them.  on 30 march 1770 the ""alarm"" was driven ashore off marseilles but with the efforts of jervis, the crew and the local french authorities under the governor of marseilles, georges rené le peley de pléville she was brought off and repaired. jervis personally returned to marseilles with a letter of thanks from the board of the admiralty to the governor for his assistance.  in 1771 ""alarm"" returned to england to collect the duke of gloucester, king george iii's brother in order that he could winter in italy. he lived aboard with his entourage until may 1772 when ""alarm"" returned to england and was paid off.  between october 1772 and june 1775, jervis travelled extensively. he began in france where he studied the language and made observations about french life. he accompanied captain samuel barrington to russia where they spent time in saint petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at kronstadt and took a tour of the yacht designed by sir charles knowles for catherine of russia. the pair continued on to sweden, denmark and northern germany. all the while jervis made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. they came home via the netherlands, jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. he and barrington then took a private cruise along the channel coast calling at various harbours including brest, making and improving their charts as they went. when jervis later became the commander-in-chief of the channel fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of brest by these charts. in later years, he commented: ""had the young captain jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the earl st vincent would not have been able to effect such a thorough blockade of it.""  at the outbreak of the american war of independence in 1775 jervis was given the command of ; however, she was surveyed by the dockyard and found unfit for service. he was therefore appointed instead to command of hms ""foudroyant"", the ship he had brought to england as a prize seventeen years earlier. for the first few years of the war, the french supplied arms, funding, and military advice on an informal and limited basis to the newly emerging nation of america. with the signing of the treaty of alliance in 1778 and the creation of the franco-american alliance, the war widened. jervis spent the first few years of the war patrolling the channel in ""foudroyant"" without seeing any significant action, but as the war reached europe jervis was placed under the command of admiral augustus keppel. the channel fleet, under keppel, sighted the french fleet intending to enter brest on 23 july. the british fleet of 30 ships of the line chased the french fleet of 29 ships and engaged them on 27 july in what became known as the first battle of ushant. the battle was indecisive and in the political aftermath jervis provided a stalwart defence of admiral keppel at the latter's court-martial, helping to secure keppel's acquittal.  jervis remained in ""foudroyant"" attached to the channel fleet and for a short time acted as flag captain to admiral molyneux shuldham. in 1780 jervis was with admiral rodney when the british fleet relieved gibraltar. in 1781 he was with admiral george darby at the second relief of gibraltar. on 19 april 1782 jervis was with his old friend and travelling companion when a ship in admiral barrington's squadron sighted a french convoy leaving brest. the squadron gave chase and ""foudroyant"" caught and engaged the french 74-gun ""pégase"". after an engagement of more than an hour ""pégase"" struck. jervis himself was wounded in the attack. for his services he was invested as a knight of the bath on 19 may 1782. he was again at the relief of gibraltar with earl howe's fleet in 1782 and took part in the indecisive battle of cape spartel. jervis was promoted commodore and hoisted his broad pennant in the 50-gun in december 1782, with orders to proceed to the west indies. due to the peace negotiations his orders were rescinded and he struck his pennant on 14 january 1783.  during the peace jervis married his cousin martha, daughter of lord chief baron sir thomas parker. jervis was also returned as mp for launceston in 1783. jervis began his political career in earnest and voted for pitt's parliamentary reforms and against charles james fox and his east india bill. during the elections of 1784 jervis stood for election in the independent borough of great yarmouth where he was returned as mp alongside henry beaufoy. jervis then voted against pitt's further bills for reform but supported him once more during the 1788–1799 regency crisis.  on 24 september 1787 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the blue and hoisted his flag in the 74-gun ""carnatic"" for several months during the tensions arising from the prussian invasion of the netherlands. in 1790 jervis was recalled to service once more and moved his flag to the second-rate ""prince"" during the nootka sound crisis that threatened war between england and spain. also in 1790 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the white and stood down as mp for great yarmouth and stood instead for the chipping wycombe seat to which he was returned as mp alongside the earl wycombe. with his interest in politics wavering he spoke rarely and then almost exclusively on naval matters. in 1794 he resigned his seat and did not stand again for political office. in 1792 jervis proposed a scheme to alleviate the financial hardship of superannuated seamen. he later withdrew the proposal as viscount melville promised that the matter would be addressed by the admiralty board.  jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the blue and was appointed to command of the leeward islands station. jervis took with him an army that, combined with the navy, formed a joint military expedition. the goal of the expedition was to capture french colonies and thereby weaken france's international trade. the army commander was sir charles grey, a friend and political ally. jervis hoisted his flag in . he took grey's son, captain george grey, later sir george grey, 1st baronet, as his flag-captain. the combined forces captured the french colonies of martinique, guadeloupe and saint lucia and restored monarchist rule.  the french counter-attacked and recaptured guadeloupe on 2 june 1794. jervis and grey landed a force to recapture the island but were repulsed by the reinforced french garrison and the british expedition withdrew. in november 1794 admiral benjamin caldwell replaced jervis. disputes over prize money were widely held as the reason that jervis and grey were not awarded peerages for their service. grey and jervis' enemies proposed a vote of censure against the general and admiral. the vote itself was negative. the prize money for the capture of the three islands, when finally calculated, amounted to £70,000 that was due to the officers and men of the navy. if adjusted for inflation this would equal approximately £ as of 20. jervis and grey were however awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament for their services. on 12 april 1794 jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the white.  jervis was promoted admiral of the blue on 1 june 1795 and appointed to command the mediterranean fleet. unfortunately the ""boyne"" had caught fire on 1 may 1795 and had blown up in spithead, the result of an accident, and jervis lost almost all of his possessions. jervis went to take command of the mediterranean fleet in the frigate and once more took charles grey's son, captain george grey, as his flag-captain. jervis also took robert calder as his captain of the fleet. on arrival at gibraltar jervis took as his flagship. among jervis' subordinates were captains horatio nelson, cuthbert collingwood and thomas troubridge. jervis began a close blockade of toulon and nelson was assigned the task of aiding the austrian army along the italian coast. by september 1796 the british presence in the mediterranean had become untenable. napoleon had beaten britain's austrian allies who were in disarray and, in october, spain had surrendered and allied themselves to the french. jervis recalled admiral robert mann to aid in the blockade of cadiz. mann took his ships instead to spithead. jervis abandoned corsica between september and november 1796 and withdrew his forces to gibraltar. a spanish fleet made up of twenty four line-of-battle ships and seven frigates sailed from toulon on 1 february 1797. jervis' fleet of ten ships-of-the-line was patrolling off cape saint vincent and was subsequently joined by five more under sir william parker. the spanish admiral, josé de córdoba, had taken his ships into the atlantic to weather a storm and was making his way to cadiz when the two fleets caught sight of each other.  the british and spanish fleet sighted one another at dawn on 14 february 1797. the british fleet had fifteen line-of-battle ships against the twenty four spanish ships. on the quarter-deck of ""victory"", jervis and his flag captain, robert calder counted the ships. it was at this point jervis discovered that he was outnumbered nearly two-to-one: ""there are eight sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty five sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty seven sail of the line, sir john"" ""enough, sir, no more of that; the die is cast, and if there are fifty sail i will go through them."" a passenger aboard ""victory"", captain benjamin hallowell, achieved a brief notoriety for slapping the admiral on the back and calling out ""that's right sir john, that's right. by god, we shall give them a damned good licking!""  during the battle nelson, in command of , wore out of line and performed a stunning feat by capturing two of the enemy vessels within moments. nelson and his crew boarded and captured one and crossed her deck and boarded and captured the second, which had collided in the smoke and general melee of the battle. the move was later feted by the public and press and dubbed """"nelson's patent bridge for boarding first-rates""."" when the spanish retreated jervis did not press his advantage but consolidated his victory and began the lengthy job of repairing both his ships and crews. the british had suffered casualties of 73 killed and 227 wounded.  sir john did not mention nelson's achievement in his initial despatch to the admiralty despite nelson's obvious contribution to the success of the battle. in later despatches jervis did mention nelson. in one anecdote, when discussing the battle with his flag-captain, sir robert, who had been mentioned in the despatch and had been awarded a knighthood for his services, brought up the issue of nelson's disobedience of the admiral's orders for having worn out of the line of battle in order to engage the enemy. jervis silenced him by saying: ""it certainly was so, and if you ever commit such a breach of your orders, i will forgive you also.""  despite the capture of only four vessels, the battle of cape saint vincent became celebrated as an outstanding victory and the awards and recognition far outweighed the achievement. the bad news of the evacuation of the mediterranean, the capitulation of the spanish and the italian city-states and the defeat of the austrian army alongside the increasing threat of a french invasion of britain had depressed the politicians and general public. a victory, such as that of cape saint vincent, was more important for the morale of the country as a whole than its military ramifications. both jervis and nelson were hailed as heroes and jervis was made baron jervis of meaford and earl st vincent. songs were written about jervis and the battle and there was a general feeling of relief in both the government and people of britain. nelson for his services was invested as a knight of the bath. the now earl st vincent was gifted a pension for life of £3,000 per year. the city of london had already presented him with the freedom of the city in a gold box valued at 100 guineas for his success in the west indies and for this battle awarded him a presentation sword. the presentation box and sword are both currently held at the national maritime museum, greenwich. nelson was also awarded his freedom of the city of london for the battle of cape st vincent, and was to get a presentation sword for the nile. the sword awarded to jervis was the first of their kind that the city of london issued. st vincent was awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament and given a gold medal by the king. the ""london gazette"" published an advertisement in 1798 regarding the prize money that was due to the officers and men who had fought at the battle. the sum quoted was £140,000, in inflationary terms this would be approximately £ as of 20, of which, as admiral, jervis was entitled to a sizeable share. jervis resumed his blockade of the spanish fleet in cadiz.  during 1797 there was considerable discontent among the seamen of the royal navy. this discontent manifested itself at the nore and at spithead when the greater part of the channel fleet rose up against their officers. these mutinies were not overly violent and the officers were put ashore and the heads of the mutinies established their own order and kept the ships under ""committee"" control until their collective demands were met. the mutineers demands ranged from discontent at cruel officers to poor pay and long sea service without shore leave. there were other mutinies throughout the navy that year, most notably and both on the jamaica station. these mutinies resulted in the crews killing their officers and taking their ships into enemy held ports.  jervis had the reputation as a disciplinarian and put in place a new system that would ensure that the men in the mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. to begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. for example, jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.  jervis discouraged conversation in irish though he did not ban it. he ordered the marine detachments to be paraded every morning and, if there was a band available, for ""god save the king"" to be played. the marine detachment was then to remain armed at all times. marines and soldiers were also excused from duties in regard to the general running of the ship.  in order to keep his crews active and to ensure that the spanish did not perceive that there might be discontent in the fleet, jervis ordered the nightly bombardment of cadiz in his own words to ""divert the animal.""  the admiral isolated the ships from one another to minimise collusion and the opportunities the men might have to band together in mutiny. st vincent did ensure, however, that the men under his command were cared for. when the stock of tobacco ran low the admiral ensured that the supply was renewed from his own funds. when the postmaster in lisbon detained the letters and packets arriving from england for the men for fear that they would carry seditious communications, jervis set up a post office aboard his flagship to receive and distribute all the letters that arrived for both seamen, marines and officers.  jervis strictly adhered to the articles of war and individual regulations that he had written for his fleet. any infraction was dealt with harshly and he was renowned for treating both officers and seamen with the same harsh discipline. as an example, one officer who allowed his boats crew to plunder a fishing boat was placed before a court martial and it was ordered that he be ""degraded from the rank of midshipman in the most ignominious manner by having his uniform stripped from his back on the quarter deck of the (ship unknown)""[sic]"". before the whole ship's company and to be further disposed of as the commander-in-chief shall direct. to be mulcted of his pay now due to him for his services on board any ship of his majesty's service and to be rendered incapable of ever serving as an officer or a petty officer in any of his majesty's ships."" jervis later personally directed that the midshipman should have his head shaved, a notice hung around his neck describing his crime and that he should be solely responsible for the cleaning of the head (naval term for the communal toilets situated at the bow of the ship) until further notice. in another incident, st vincent instructed that two men aboard who were tried for mutiny on a saturday were executed on sunday. the men were duly executed but admiral charles thompson raised an objection to formal executions on the sabbath and jervis wrote to the board of admiralty demanding thompson's removal or that they accept his own resignation. the board relieved thompson. on 9 july 1797 nelson wrote to jervis congratulating him in his resolve and wholeheartedly supporting his decision to execute the men on a sunday.  jervis could also be exceptionally kind when he felt that the situation warranted it. on one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. the men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. one of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. in one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. the bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. the admiral saw the man and asked the problem. one of his officers told him and st vincent went to his cabin. when he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. ""roger odell you are convicted, sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the british oak with tears. what have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?"" the man told him what had happened and st vincent replied ""roger odell you are one of the best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life i never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the victory in the action with the spanish fleet. to show therefore that your commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. there is your money sir!"" the earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor ""but no more tears mind, no more tears sir"".  when nelson returned to the mediterranean st vincent wrote to earl spencer, first lord of the admiralty: ""i do assure your lordship that the arrival of admiral nelson has given me new life; you could not have gratified me more than in sending him. his presence in the mediterranean is so very essential."" st vincent detached nelson to pursue napoleon in his invasion of egypt rear-admiral sir john orde who was senior to nelson complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight. jervis ordered orde home. orde requested that he be court-martialled in order that he might have the opportunity to clear his name. the board refused. orde then requested that st vincent be brought before a court-martial. again, the board refused. the board censured jervis for not having supported his subordinates. orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. the challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered jervis to decline. before the challenge was formally declined, orde wrote to the board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.  when the men aboard the refused to execute a man for mutinous behaviour and their captain did nothing, the earl threatened the captain with replacement and had boats from the rest of the fleet armed with carronades surround the ""marlborough""; he then threatened to sink the ship if his orders were not carried out. the man was duly executed. st vincent turned to an officer beside him watching the mutineer hanging from the yard arm and said ""discipline is preserved, sir!""  between 1797 and 1799 alongside the suppression of mutiny jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of gibraltar including building a new victualling yard and water tanks to replenish his ships. after the battle of the nile the dockyards, under jervis' watchful eye, managed to successfully repair most of the fleet. lady lavinia bingham, wife of earl spencer wrote to st vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the nile. ""never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward than yours has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend."" nelson commented that he had ""never beheld a fleet equal to sir john jervis'"" having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water the admiral arranged for large tanks to be built in gibraltar. on 14 february 1799 st vincent was created admiral of the white. constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. despite his failing health, st vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the board reluctant to supersede him. by 17 june 1799 he had no choice but to resign his command and return to england. during his time ashore the earl lived in rochetts, essex with his wife.  as his health had improved he was given command of the channel fleet. st vincent was to comment ""the king and the government require it and the discipline of the british navy demands it. it is of no consequence to me whether i die afloat or ashore. the die is cast.""  he took command of the channel fleet in on 26 april 1800 and took up a close blockade of brest. once at brest he transferred to the ""ville de paris"" of 110 guns and took sir thomas troubridge as his captain of the fleet. he was also accompanied by his personal physician, doctor andrew baird. baird was later to become instrumental in the plans of the commander-in-chief and the health and well being of the channel fleet.  st vincent's appointment was not popular among the officers of the channel fleet. his reputation as a strict disciplinarian had followed him from the mediterranean and he immediately issued orders banning officers and captains from sleeping ashore and forbade them from travelling more than three miles from their ship. among other strict regulations introduced were orders that ships were to be repaired where possible at sea and that ushant was to be the official rendezvous for the channel fleet rather than the traditional torbay. the wife of one of his captains is said to have toasted the news of his appointment with the line ""may his next glass of wine choke the wretch."" ships were forbidden to go to spithead without specific written orders from the admiral or admiralty. during his command he remained with the fleet and became respected by the officers and men for suffering their hardships with them.  with the charts that he had made with barrington in 1775 the inshore squadron at brest was able to keep a much tighter blockade. in one incident, the inshore squadron sighted several french ships leaving brest. sir edward pellew, captain of hms ""impétueux"", gave chase. the rear admiral in charge of the inshore squadron recalled him, worried that the ""impétueux"" would run aground. the french escaped. after several letters went back and forth between the two admirals, st vincent, tired of his subordinate's excuses, took the entire offshore squadron and sailed them between the inshore squadron and the shore thus proving that the ships had a shallow enough draught to have given chase and captured the french. st vincent then wrote to the rear admiral and suggested that he strike his flag and return to shore for some needed rest.  st vincent was as generous in the channel as he had been in the mediterranean. a particular letter from england made the admiral host a dinner aboard the flagship for fifty of the officers whom he felt closest to. at the dinner he revealed that the letter was from an orphanage near paddington in london. the orphanage had run out of money to support the children of sailors who had died in the service of their country. st vincent solicited from each captain and lieutenant a sum of money and then added his own donation. the cutter sailed back to england the same evening. st vincent gave the orphanage £1,000  st vincent's skills as an administrator and logistician came into play and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. st vincent wrote to earl spencer, commenting ""i have ever considered the care of the sick and wounded as one of the first duties of a commander-in-chief, by sea or land."" based on doctor baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of fresh lemon juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. the effect was dramatic. the hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in november 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. in a letter to sir evan nepean, first secretary to the admiralty, st vincent described baird as ""the most valuable man in the navy not excepting the board itself,"" the oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at torre abbey overlooking torbay. vice-admiral sir henry harvey took over operational command of the fleet in st vincent's absence.  in 1801 in a letter to the board of admiralty, st vincent made the now famous remark: ""i do not say, my lords, that the french will not come. i say only they will not come by sea."" in 1801 st vincent was replaced by admiral william cornwallis and the new prime minister henry addington promoted st vincent to first lord of the admiralty.   in january 1801 st vincent had written a short letter to the then first lord earl spencer stating: ""nothing short of a radical sweep in the dockyards can cure the enormous evils and corruptions in them; and this cannot be attempted till we have peace."" as first lord st vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the navy, the royal dockyards and their civilian administration. consequently, he clashed with the various navy boards, the civil administration of the royal navy that administered among other things the navy yards and stores. st vincent saw these boards and individuals as hindering the efforts of the navy.  during the peace with france, after the treaty of amiens was signed on 25 march 1802, st vincent ordered the navy board to begin an investigation for fraud and corruption in the royal dockyards. he swiftly found that the investigations were not being conducted effectively and ordered the commissioners to retrieve all logs and accounts and inventories and put them under their ""personal seal"" in anticipation of the admiralty board travelling to the various yards itself and conducting their own inspection. the investigation began in earnest in 1802. st vincent swiftly uncovered casual and obvious abuses of the system. some men were listed as having done work, then over-time and then acted as night watchmen for years without a break of any kind. others were listed as workmen ashore but also as sailors receiving pay in the receiving ship. work was done and then the identical work was charged for over various periods, often by different departments or sections. in another yard, ""the men of an entire department were found to be incapables, as old, infirm boys, cripples, or idiots, and the department itself to have the appearance of an asylum for every rogue and vagabond that could not obtain a meal by any other means."" st vincent found that minor dockyard officials were the tip of a far bigger corruption. he lobbied the government to create a special commission of inquiry that would have the power to question suspects under oath. the cabinet determined that the outcome of such an inquiry might be damaging politically (and possibly in some cases, personally) and gave the board of inquiry permission to question suspects under oath but gave the suspects the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate themselves. this addendum removed the ability of the inquiry to act effectively in any way. the commission of inquiry produced twelve reports:   one of st vincent's biographers put the findings of the commission succinctly ""the valuable british oak rotted in the forests for want of the axe; the frames building rotted on the stocks for want of timber; the ships at sea rotted before their day because constructed of such worthless perishable materials.""   one reform st vincent did achieve was the introduction of block making machinery at the navy yard in portsmouth. the machinery was designed by marc isambard brunel and samuel bentham. by 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. the innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost of the project was recovered in three years. the revolution of machinery enabled the navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. this self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. the buildings that housed the block machinery remain to this day and make up part of the historic portsmouth dockyard.  as first lord, st vincent also determined to build a breakwater in plymouth. the first lord commissioned a civil engineer, john rennie, and joseph whidbey, the former master-attendant at woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.  st vincent spoke with the king regarding the contribution made by marines to the general service of the navy and recommended to the king that the prefix ""royal"" be added. these were the first official discussions into the retitling of the corps to royal marines.  during his tenure, the workers in the royal dockyards demanded an increase in pay due to an increase in living costs. st vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken an active role in the strike. he eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.  st vincent's gaze passed over every aspect of the navy from the sea fencibles to the navy hospitals. the earl attempted to disband the sea fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. doctor baird, st vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the sick and hurt board as inspector of all hospitals.  another burden of his promotion to first lord of the admiralty was that st vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers and their relatives and friends. soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. the more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. also, due to the peace with france the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. the first lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. despite st vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the admiralty.  the ways in which st vincent chose to communicate the rejections often depended on the number of letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. to the earl of portsmouth he wrote: ""i cannot possibly agree in opinion with your lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime."" a harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: ""although i cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of captain (name unknown) ""[sic.]"", there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which i lose no time in acknowledging;""  famously, when commander lord cochrane captured the 32-gun spanish frigate ""el gamo"" in the 14-gun sloop a promotion was the usual reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. it would be fair to argue that it would have been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. unfortunately for cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the french and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. a court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including cochrane's, it was only a formality. it was only when cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. unfortunately the commander thought that the first lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. these solicitations may have had a negative effect on cochrane's career as it is possible that jervis became irritated by them.  the detailed investigation into corruption that st vincent began caused him to become extremely unpopular as many influential men were involved in the various money making schemes perpetrated. the board of inquiry set up by st vincent was responsible for the impeachment of henry dundas, 1st viscount melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. st vincent had made an enemy of pitt and pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the first lord and the addington administration. st vincent left the office on 14 may 1804 when addington was replaced as prime minister by pitt. lord howick, second son of st vincent's friend sir charles grey came to his defence and with the assistance of charles james fox moved for a vote of thanks in the commons for st vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.  on 14 may 1806, john jeffery, one of the members of parliament for poole, opened a parliamentary debate condemning st vincent for ""unprecedented neglect in building and repairing of ships while his lordship presided at the board of admiralty and with delivering up the navy to his successor in a far less efficient state than that in which he received it"". this motion was rejected and instead the foreign secretary, charles james fox, proposed a vote of thanks to earl st vincent, ""that it appears to this house, that the conduct of the earl of st. vincent, in his late naval administration, has added an additional lustre to his exalted character, and is entitled to the approbation of this house.""  fox had said of st vincent's appointment in 1801 ""allow me to say, that i do not think it would be easy, if possible, to find a man in the whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person at the head of the admiralty – i mean the earl of st vincent."" and had continued his support of the earl throughout his time as first lord.  on 9 november 1805 st vincent was promoted admiral of the red. he took command of the channel fleet once more in the 110-gun first-rate . during his tenure in command he spent much of his time at a house that he rented in the village of rame. once again he issued the orders that had become so effective in the mediterranean and his previous channel command. once again these orders proved unpopular. for a short time in 1806 he gave command of the channel fleet to his second-in-command sir charles cotton in order that he might travel to portugal on a particular mission. portugal was under threat of invasion and st vincent had been ordered, if necessary, to take the portuguese court to its colony in brazil. the invasion of portugal was delayed and st vincent was recalled to the channel fleet. it was sir sidney smith and graham moore who led the royal family to safety in brazil. st vincent had long suffered from poor health and a change in government led to his resignation on 24 april 1807.  the earl had always attempted to promote on merit rather than patronage and had become increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. at his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the king. the king asked if the navy were a better institution now than it had been on st vincent's entrance into it. st vincent replied that it was not. he stated: ""sire i have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of members of parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on."" he continued on ""i would rather promote the son of an old deserving officer than of any noble in the land."" in a letter dated 18 october 1806 to viscount howick, then the first lord. ""if you will, my good lord, bring a bill into parliament to disqualify any officer under the rank of rear-admiral to sit in the house of commons, the navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than i possess to command your fleets."" presumably st vincent was referring to a particular member of parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.  in his retirement he seldom took his seat in the house of lords and made his last appearance in either 1810 or 1811. during these final years st vincent gave generously to various charities, organisations and individuals. he donated £500 to the wounded and survivors of the battle of waterloo and £300 to relieve starvation in ireland. st vincent also donated £100 to the building of a jewish chapel in whitechapel, london. in 1807 st vincent, as a member of the house of lords, opposed a bill to abolish the slave trade. his motives appear to have been practical rather than humanitarian or otherwise. st vincent argued that if britain were to ban the trade it would simply be continued by other countries and thereby britain would lose the revenue generated and be weakened accordingly. st vincent spoke in opposition to the convention of sintra he spoke against the walcheren campaign and then condemned its failure, although conspicuously excluded the failure of its officers and men. st vincent spoke in defence of lieutenant-general sir john moore's retreat through spain and portugal and condemned the government and army commanders for failure to support him thoroughly. in 1816 his wife martha died at rochetts in essex. the couple had no children. in the winter of 1818–1819 st vincent went to recover his health in france. when he arrived at toulon he was greeted by admiral édouard missiessy who said of st vincent that he was: ""as much the father of the french as of the english navy"".  in 1800 st vincent was made an honorary lieutenant-general of marines and in 1814 was promoted to general. these positions were little more than a sinecure and carried no official duties. in 1801 st vincent had been created viscount st vincent of meaford, staffordshire. a title that because he had no children passed to his nephew, edward jervis ricketts. in 1806 he was appointed as one of the thirty one elder brothers of trinity house. the elder brothers, along with the master, form the court of trinity house. in 1809 st vincent was honoured by john vi of portugal who awarded him the royal portuguese military order of the tower and sword in order to commemorate the safe arrival of the royal family in brazil, after napoleon had invaded portugal. in may 1814 he was promoted acting admiral of the fleet and commander-in-chief of the channel squadron. he was confirmed admiral of the fleet on 19 july 1821 and george iv sent him a gold topped baton as a symbol of the office. the baton is currently held in the collections of the national maritime museum, greenwich. on 2 january 1815 he was made knight grand cross of the order of the bath when the order was rearranged by the prince regent. the knight grand cross is the highest rank in the order.  st vincent died on 13 march 1823 and, because he had no children, the barony of jervis and the earldom of st vincent became extinct. his nephew, edward jervis ricketts, became the 2nd viscount st vincent and changed his surname to jervis, becoming edward jervis jervis in honour of his uncle. st vincent was buried at stone, staffordshire, in the family mausoleum, at his own request and a monument was erected in the crypt of st. paul's cathedral.  at least three ships and two stone frigates (or shore establishments) have been named either in honour of the earl or after that battle that he won. , commissioned in 1910, was the first of her class and therefore the class of battleship was named after her. the ""st. vincent""–class battleships included and . , a j-class destroyer, launched just prior to the second world war, was named after the admiral. hms ""jervis"" served throughout the war. she was known as a lucky ship as, despite taking part in several actions, she never lost a man to enemy fire. hms ""jervis bay"", an armed merchant cruiser that was lost in heroic circumstances, was indirectly named after him.  jervis has also been remembered in schools in england. he has a boarding house (saint vincent) named in his honour at the royal hospital school. st vincent college in gosport, england is named after the admiral's most famous battle.  as with many other officers during the great age of discovery there are several areas of the world named in the earl's honour. cape jervis and gulf st vincent, south australia, and jervis bay, new south wales, australia were named for him as was the town of vincentia and jervis bay national park. the county of st vincent, new south wales was also named in his honour. jervis inlet, in british columbia, canada, was also named for him.  though jervis clearly had a strong impact during the napoleonic wars and afterwards on the development of the navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of jervis are available, and those are seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. the most recent work related to jervis is ""the remaking of the english navy by admiral st. vincent: the great unclaimed naval revolution"" by charles arthur, 1986, but this focused more on jervis's reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. evelyn berkman's ""nelson's dear lord: portrait of st. vincent"" (1962), as the bibliographer eugene rasor points out, is merely an ""effort"" to create a biography. the same bibliographer says much the same about william milbourne james's """"old oak"": the life of john jervis, earl st. vincent"" (1950) and owen sherrard's ""a life of lord st. vincent"" (1933), pointing to both as mediocre. ruddock mackay published an article which documented the early life of jervis.","3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4","3, 3, 2, 4,

84,Czech,"by the end of the 1763 'gosport' was paid out and jervis remain unemployed in february 1769 when he was appointed on 32-gun, the first coppered warship of the royal navy.","admiral of the fleet john jervis, 1st earl of st vincent (9 january 1735 – 14 march 1823) was an admiral in the royal navy and member of parliament in the united kingdom. jervis served throughout the latter half of the 18th century and into the 19th, and was an active commander during the seven years' war, american war of independence, french revolutionary war and the napoleonic wars. he is best known for his victory at the 1797 battle of cape saint vincent, from which he earned his titles, and as a patron of horatio nelson.  jervis was also recognised by both political and military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. as commander-in-chief of the mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. he applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy that made him a controversial figure. he took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the channel fleet in 1799. in 1801, as first lord of the admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. he introduced innovations including block making machinery at portsmouth royal dockyard. st vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.  jervis' entry in the ""oxford dictionary of national biography"" by p. k. crimmin describes his contribution to history: ""his importance lies in his being the organiser of victories; the creator of well-equipped, highly efficient fleets; and in training a school of officers as professional, energetic, and devoted to the service as himself.""  john jervis was born in meaford, staffordshire, on 9 january 1735, the second son of swynfen and elizabeth jervis. his father was a barrister, counsellor to the admiralty board and auditor of greenwich hospital.<ref name=""nc02/1"">""the naval chronicle"" vol. 4, pp. 2–3.</ref> swynfen jervis intended that his son should follow him to the bar. the young jervis was educated at burton-upon-trent grammar school and subsequently at reverend swinden's academy in greenwich, london.  their family name jervis is pronounced 'jarviss'. the name jervis originates from the norman name gervase.  at the age of thirteen jervis ran away and joined the navy at woolwich, london. after a short time he returned home as he had heard his family were very upset at his disappearance. lady jane hamilton (mother of sir william hamilton) and lady burlington became aware of jervis' desire to join the navy and lobbied his family on his behalf. eventually they introduced the jervis family to admiral george townshend who agreed to take the boy aboard one of his ships.  on 4 january 1749 jervis entered the navy as an able seaman aboard the 50-gun on her way to jamaica. on arrival in the west indies, jervis was detached on hm sloop to the mosquito coast where he saw constant service against spanish guarda-costas and privateers. when townshend quit the west indies he discharged jervis into the under admiral thomas cotes. cotes' flag captain henry dennis rated jervis as a midshipman. on 31 july 1754 jervis moved to the 24-gun . jervis commented in a letter to his sister: ""my chief employ when from my duty is reading studying navigation and perusing my old letters of which i have almost enough to make an octavo volume."" while in jamaica, the young jervis drew funds against his father's account with a local banker. when the reply came from england that the withdrawal could not be honoured, the midshipman found himself in debt. jervis was forced to quit his mess and live on ship's rations in order to pay off the loan. the event deeply affected the young jervis who swore never to ""draw another bill without the certainty of it being paid"". ""sphinx"" was paid off at spithead on 7 november 1754. jervis was assigned to the 20-gun in december of the same year and then from the end of december until february 1755 was assigned to hm yacht ""william and mary"" under the navigational expert captain john campbell.  jervis passed his lieutenant's examination on 2 january 1755 and was assigned as sixth lieutenant to the first-rate of 100 guns. by march, he had moved to third lieutenant of the 60-gun . the ""nottingham"" was part of edward boscawen's fleet that attempted to prevent french reinforcements reaching new france. on 31 march 1756 jervis moved to the 74-gun hms and on 22 june he was promoted to be fourth lieutenant of the 90-gun ""prince"" under captain charles saunders in the mediterranean. when the captain was promoted to admiral, jervis followed him to the 74-gun in november 1756. in january 1757 jervis was promoted to temporary command of . in her, he fought a large french privateer in an indecisive action off cape gata. when the captain of the ""experiment"" regained his health jervis moved back to the ""culloden"". in june 1757, he followed saunders to the 90-gun hms ""st george"". jervis returned to england in temporary command of the 80-gun , a ship that had been captured by henry osborn's fleet at the battle of cartagena. he followed saunders once more when the admiral was promoted to command the north american station; jervis was promoted to lieutenant of hms ""prince"".  the fleet, part of an expedition to capture the french possessions in north america, left england in february 1759. they stopped first at louisbourg, which had been captured from the french the previous year. by june, the ice along the saint lawrence river had broken up and the fleet along with the military transports headed up river to the assault of quebec city. on 15 may 1759, jervis had been promoted acting commander of the sloop . in this command jervis impressed general james wolfe in the preparations that led to the battle of the plains of abraham. ""porcupine"" and the frigate led the armed transports past quebec to land up river. one biographer, jedediah tucker, notes that as the approach was so critical, both wolfe and the subsequently famous james cook boarded the ""porcupine"" to ensure the success of the mission.  for his efforts jervis was promoted commander and took command of . jervis returned to england in september but immediately returned to north america in command of the ""albany"". in may 1760 jervis was attached to admiral sir george rodney's channel squadron.  in october 1760 he was made post-captain in command of the 44-gun . ""gosport"" had on board a young midshipman, george elphinstone, later viscount keith, who took over jervis' command in the mediterranean after jervis' departure in 1799. in 1762, hms ""gosport"", and under captain joshua rowley, convoyed the east and west indian trade to the westward, and successfully protected it from the squadron of commodore de ternay.","he was tasked with delivering bullion to the english merchants in genoa. during his time in genoa two turkish slaves escaped a genoese galley and hid aboard one of ""alarm"" boats. they were forcibly removed; jervis made an official protest and promised retaliation if they were not handed over. the slaves were produced and jervis took custody of them.  on 30 march 1770 the ""alarm"" was driven ashore off marseilles but with the efforts of jervis, the crew and the local french authorities under the governor of marseilles, georges rené le peley de pléville she was brought off and repaired. jervis personally returned to marseilles with a letter of thanks from the board of the admiralty to the governor for his assistance.  in 1771 ""alarm"" returned to england to collect the duke of gloucester, king george iii's brother in order that he could winter in italy. he lived aboard with his entourage until may 1772 when ""alarm"" returned to england and was paid off.  between october 1772 and june 1775, jervis travelled extensively. he began in france where he studied the language and made observations about french life. he accompanied captain samuel barrington to russia where they spent time in saint petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at kronstadt and took a tour of the yacht designed by sir charles knowles for catherine of russia. the pair continued on to sweden, denmark and northern germany. all the while jervis made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. they came home via the netherlands, jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. he and barrington then took a private cruise along the channel coast calling at various harbours including brest, making and improving their charts as they went. when jervis later became the commander-in-chief of the channel fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of brest by these charts. in later years, he commented: ""had the young captain jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the earl st vincent would not have been able to effect such a thorough blockade of it.""  at the outbreak of the american war of independence in 1775 jervis was given the command of ; however, she was surveyed by the dockyard and found unfit for service. he was therefore appointed instead to command of hms ""foudroyant"", the ship he had brought to england as a prize seventeen years earlier. for the first few years of the war, the french supplied arms, funding, and military advice on an informal and limited basis to the newly emerging nation of america. with the signing of the treaty of alliance in 1778 and the creation of the franco-american alliance, the war widened. jervis spent the first few years of the war patrolling the channel in ""foudroyant"" without seeing any significant action, but as the war reached europe jervis was placed under the command of admiral augustus keppel. the channel fleet, under keppel, sighted the french fleet intending to enter brest on 23 july. the british fleet of 30 ships of the line chased the french fleet of 29 ships and engaged them on 27 july in what became known as the first battle of ushant. the battle was indecisive and in the political aftermath jervis provided a stalwart defence of admiral keppel at the latter's court-martial, helping to secure keppel's acquittal.  jervis remained in ""foudroyant"" attached to the channel fleet and for a short time acted as flag captain to admiral molyneux shuldham. in 1780 jervis was with admiral rodney when the british fleet relieved gibraltar. in 1781 he was with admiral george darby at the second relief of gibraltar. on 19 april 1782 jervis was with his old friend and travelling companion when a ship in admiral barrington's squadron sighted a french convoy leaving brest. the squadron gave chase and ""foudroyant"" caught and engaged the french 74-gun ""pégase"". after an engagement of more than an hour ""pégase"" struck. jervis himself was wounded in the attack. for his services he was invested as a knight of the bath on 19 may 1782. he was again at the relief of gibraltar with earl howe's fleet in 1782 and took part in the indecisive battle of cape spartel. jervis was promoted commodore and hoisted his broad pennant in the 50-gun in december 1782, with orders to proceed to the west indies. due to the peace negotiations his orders were rescinded and he struck his pennant on 14 january 1783.  during the peace jervis married his cousin martha, daughter of lord chief baron sir thomas parker. jervis was also returned as mp for launceston in 1783. jervis began his political career in earnest and voted for pitt's parliamentary reforms and against charles james fox and his east india bill. during the elections of 1784 jervis stood for election in the independent borough of great yarmouth where he was returned as mp alongside henry beaufoy. jervis then voted against pitt's further bills for reform but supported him once more during the 1788–1799 regency crisis.  on 24 september 1787 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the blue and hoisted his flag in the 74-gun ""carnatic"" for several months during the tensions arising from the prussian invasion of the netherlands. in 1790 jervis was recalled to service once more and moved his flag to the second-rate ""prince"" during the nootka sound crisis that threatened war between england and spain. also in 1790 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the white and stood down as mp for great yarmouth and stood instead for the chipping wycombe seat to which he was returned as mp alongside the earl wycombe. with his interest in politics wavering he spoke rarely and then almost exclusively on naval matters. in 1794 he resigned his seat and did not stand again for political office. in 1792 jervis proposed a scheme to alleviate the financial hardship of superannuated seamen. he later withdrew the proposal as viscount melville promised that the matter would be addressed by the admiralty board.  jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the blue and was appointed to command of the leeward islands station. jervis took with him an army that, combined with the navy, formed a joint military expedition. the goal of the expedition was to capture french colonies and thereby weaken france's international trade. the army commander was sir charles grey, a friend and political ally. jervis hoisted his flag in . he took grey's son, captain george grey, later sir george grey, 1st baronet, as his flag-captain. the combined forces captured the french colonies of martinique, guadeloupe and saint lucia and restored monarchist rule.  the french counter-attacked and recaptured guadeloupe on 2 june 1794. jervis and grey landed a force to recapture the island but were repulsed by the reinforced french garrison and the british expedition withdrew. in november 1794 admiral benjamin caldwell replaced jervis. disputes over prize money were widely held as the reason that jervis and grey were not awarded peerages for their service. grey and jervis' enemies proposed a vote of censure against the general and admiral. the vote itself was negative. the prize money for the capture of the three islands, when finally calculated, amounted to £70,000 that was due to the officers and men of the navy. if adjusted for inflation this would equal approximately £ as of 20. jervis and grey were however awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament for their services. on 12 april 1794 jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the white.  jervis was promoted admiral of the blue on 1 june 1795 and appointed to command the mediterranean fleet. unfortunately the ""boyne"" had caught fire on 1 may 1795 and had blown up in spithead, the result of an accident, and jervis lost almost all of his possessions. jervis went to take command of the mediterranean fleet in the frigate and once more took charles grey's son, captain george grey, as his flag-captain. jervis also took robert calder as his captain of the fleet. on arrival at gibraltar jervis took as his flagship. among jervis' subordinates were captains horatio nelson, cuthbert collingwood and thomas troubridge. jervis began a close blockade of toulon and nelson was assigned the task of aiding the austrian army along the italian coast. by september 1796 the british presence in the mediterranean had become untenable. napoleon had beaten britain's austrian allies who were in disarray and, in october, spain had surrendered and allied themselves to the french. jervis recalled admiral robert mann to aid in the blockade of cadiz. mann took his ships instead to spithead. jervis abandoned corsica between september and november 1796 and withdrew his forces to gibraltar. a spanish fleet made up of twenty four line-of-battle ships and seven frigates sailed from toulon on 1 february 1797. jervis' fleet of ten ships-of-the-line was patrolling off cape saint vincent and was subsequently joined by five more under sir william parker. the spanish admiral, josé de córdoba, had taken his ships into the atlantic to weather a storm and was making his way to cadiz when the two fleets caught sight of each other.  the british and spanish fleet sighted one another at dawn on 14 february 1797. the british fleet had fifteen line-of-battle ships against the twenty four spanish ships. on the quarter-deck of ""victory"", jervis and his flag captain, robert calder counted the ships. it was at this point jervis discovered that he was outnumbered nearly two-to-one: ""there are eight sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty five sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty seven sail of the line, sir john"" ""enough, sir, no more of that; the die is cast, and if there are fifty sail i will go through them."" a passenger aboard ""victory"", captain benjamin hallowell, achieved a brief notoriety for slapping the admiral on the back and calling out ""that's right sir john, that's right. by god, we shall give them a damned good licking!""  during the battle nelson, in command of , wore out of line and performed a stunning feat by capturing two of the enemy vessels within moments. nelson and his crew boarded and captured one and crossed her deck and boarded and captured the second, which had collided in the smoke and general melee of the battle. the move was later feted by the public and press and dubbed """"nelson's patent bridge for boarding first-rates""."" when the spanish retreated jervis did not press his advantage but consolidated his victory and began the lengthy job of repairing both his ships and crews. the british had suffered casualties of 73 killed and 227 wounded.  sir john did not mention nelson's achievement in his initial despatch to the admiralty despite nelson's obvious contribution to the success of the battle. in later despatches jervis did mention nelson. in one anecdote, when discussing the battle with his flag-captain, sir robert, who had been mentioned in the despatch and had been awarded a knighthood for his services, brought up the issue of nelson's disobedience of the admiral's orders for having worn out of the line of battle in order to engage the enemy. jervis silenced him by saying: ""it certainly was so, and if you ever commit such a breach of your orders, i will forgive you also.""  despite the capture of only four vessels, the battle of cape saint vincent became celebrated as an outstanding victory and the awards and recognition far outweighed the achievement. the bad news of the evacuation of the mediterranean, the capitulation of the spanish and the italian city-states and the defeat of the austrian army alongside the increasing threat of a french invasion of britain had depressed the politicians and general public. a victory, such as that of cape saint vincent, was more important for the morale of the country as a whole than its military ramifications. both jervis and nelson were hailed as heroes and jervis was made baron jervis of meaford and earl st vincent. songs were written about jervis and the battle and there was a general feeling of relief in both the government and people of britain. nelson for his services was invested as a knight of the bath. the now earl st vincent was gifted a pension for life of £3,000 per year. the city of london had already presented him with the freedom of the city in a gold box valued at 100 guineas for his success in the west indies and for this battle awarded him a presentation sword. the presentation box and sword are both currently held at the national maritime museum, greenwich. nelson was also awarded his freedom of the city of london for the battle of cape st vincent, and was to get a presentation sword for the nile. the sword awarded to jervis was the first of their kind that the city of london issued. st vincent was awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament and given a gold medal by the king. the ""london gazette"" published an advertisement in 1798 regarding the prize money that was due to the officers and men who had fought at the battle. the sum quoted was £140,000, in inflationary terms this would be approximately £ as of 20, of which, as admiral, jervis was entitled to a sizeable share. jervis resumed his blockade of the spanish fleet in cadiz.  during 1797 there was considerable discontent among the seamen of the royal navy. this discontent manifested itself at the nore and at spithead when the greater part of the channel fleet rose up against their officers. these mutinies were not overly violent and the officers were put ashore and the heads of the mutinies established their own order and kept the ships under ""committee"" control until their collective demands were met. the mutineers demands ranged from discontent at cruel officers to poor pay and long sea service without shore leave. there were other mutinies throughout the navy that year, most notably and both on the jamaica station. these mutinies resulted in the crews killing their officers and taking their ships into enemy held ports.  jervis had the reputation as a disciplinarian and put in place a new system that would ensure that the men in the mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. to begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. for example, jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.  jervis discouraged conversation in irish though he did not ban it. he ordered the marine detachments to be paraded every morning and, if there was a band available, for ""god save the king"" to be played. the marine detachment was then to remain armed at all times. marines and soldiers were also excused from duties in regard to the general running of the ship.  in order to keep his crews active and to ensure that the spanish did not perceive that there might be discontent in the fleet, jervis ordered the nightly bombardment of cadiz in his own words to ""divert the animal.""  the admiral isolated the ships from one another to minimise collusion and the opportunities the men might have to band together in mutiny. st vincent did ensure, however, that the men under his command were cared for. when the stock of tobacco ran low the admiral ensured that the supply was renewed from his own funds. when the postmaster in lisbon detained the letters and packets arriving from england for the men for fear that they would carry seditious communications, jervis set up a post office aboard his flagship to receive and distribute all the letters that arrived for both seamen, marines and officers.  jervis strictly adhered to the articles of war and individual regulations that he had written for his fleet. any infraction was dealt with harshly and he was renowned for treating both officers and seamen with the same harsh discipline. as an example, one officer who allowed his boats crew to plunder a fishing boat was placed before a court martial and it was ordered that he be ""degraded from the rank of midshipman in the most ignominious manner by having his uniform stripped from his back on the quarter deck of the (ship unknown)""[sic]"". before the whole ship's company and to be further disposed of as the commander-in-chief shall direct. to be mulcted of his pay now due to him for his services on board any ship of his majesty's service and to be rendered incapable of ever serving as an officer or a petty officer in any of his majesty's ships."" jervis later personally directed that the midshipman should have his head shaved, a notice hung around his neck describing his crime and that he should be solely responsible for the cleaning of the head (naval term for the communal toilets situated at the bow of the ship) until further notice. in another incident, st vincent instructed that two men aboard who were tried for mutiny on a saturday were executed on sunday. the men were duly executed but admiral charles thompson raised an objection to formal executions on the sabbath and jervis wrote to the board of admiralty demanding thompson's removal or that they accept his own resignation. the board relieved thompson. on 9 july 1797 nelson wrote to jervis congratulating him in his resolve and wholeheartedly supporting his decision to execute the men on a sunday.  jervis could also be exceptionally kind when he felt that the situation warranted it. on one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. the men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. one of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. in one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. the bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. the admiral saw the man and asked the problem. one of his officers told him and st vincent went to his cabin. when he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. ""roger odell you are convicted, sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the british oak with tears. what have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?"" the man told him what had happened and st vincent replied ""roger odell you are one of the best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life i never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the victory in the action with the spanish fleet. to show therefore that your commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. there is your money sir!"" the earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor ""but no more tears mind, no more tears sir"".  when nelson returned to the mediterranean st vincent wrote to earl spencer, first lord of the admiralty: ""i do assure your lordship that the arrival of admiral nelson has given me new life; you could not have gratified me more than in sending him. his presence in the mediterranean is so very essential."" st vincent detached nelson to pursue napoleon in his invasion of egypt rear-admiral sir john orde who was senior to nelson complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight. jervis ordered orde home. orde requested that he be court-martialled in order that he might have the opportunity to clear his name. the board refused. orde then requested that st vincent be brought before a court-martial. again, the board refused. the board censured jervis for not having supported his subordinates. orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. the challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered jervis to decline. before the challenge was formally declined, orde wrote to the board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.  when the men aboard the refused to execute a man for mutinous behaviour and their captain did nothing, the earl threatened the captain with replacement and had boats from the rest of the fleet armed with carronades surround the ""marlborough""; he then threatened to sink the ship if his orders were not carried out. the man was duly executed. st vincent turned to an officer beside him watching the mutineer hanging from the yard arm and said ""discipline is preserved, sir!""  between 1797 and 1799 alongside the suppression of mutiny jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of gibraltar including building a new victualling yard and water tanks to replenish his ships. after the battle of the nile the dockyards, under jervis' watchful eye, managed to successfully repair most of the fleet. lady lavinia bingham, wife of earl spencer wrote to st vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the nile. ""never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward than yours has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend."" nelson commented that he had ""never beheld a fleet equal to sir john jervis'"" having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water the admiral arranged for large tanks to be built in gibraltar. on 14 february 1799 st vincent was created admiral of the white. constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. despite his failing health, st vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the board reluctant to supersede him. by 17 june 1799 he had no choice but to resign his command and return to england. during his time ashore the earl lived in rochetts, essex with his wife.  as his health had improved he was given command of the channel fleet. st vincent was to comment ""the king and the government require it and the discipline of the british navy demands it. it is of no consequence to me whether i die afloat or ashore. the die is cast.""  he took command of the channel fleet in on 26 april 1800 and took up a close blockade of brest. once at brest he transferred to the ""ville de paris"" of 110 guns and took sir thomas troubridge as his captain of the fleet. he was also accompanied by his personal physician, doctor andrew baird. baird was later to become instrumental in the plans of the commander-in-chief and the health and well being of the channel fleet.  st vincent's appointment was not popular among the officers of the channel fleet. his reputation as a strict disciplinarian had followed him from the mediterranean and he immediately issued orders banning officers and captains from sleeping ashore and forbade them from travelling more than three miles from their ship. among other strict regulations introduced were orders that ships were to be repaired where possible at sea and that ushant was to be the official rendezvous for the channel fleet rather than the traditional torbay. the wife of one of his captains is said to have toasted the news of his appointment with the line ""may his next glass of wine choke the wretch."" ships were forbidden to go to spithead without specific written orders from the admiral or admiralty. during his command he remained with the fleet and became respected by the officers and men for suffering their hardships with them.  with the charts that he had made with barrington in 1775 the inshore squadron at brest was able to keep a much tighter blockade. in one incident, the inshore squadron sighted several french ships leaving brest. sir edward pellew, captain of hms ""impétueux"", gave chase. the rear admiral in charge of the inshore squadron recalled him, worried that the ""impétueux"" would run aground. the french escaped. after several letters went back and forth between the two admirals, st vincent, tired of his subordinate's excuses, took the entire offshore squadron and sailed them between the inshore squadron and the shore thus proving that the ships had a shallow enough draught to have given chase and captured the french. st vincent then wrote to the rear admiral and suggested that he strike his flag and return to shore for some needed rest.  st vincent was as generous in the channel as he had been in the mediterranean. a particular letter from england made the admiral host a dinner aboard the flagship for fifty of the officers whom he felt closest to. at the dinner he revealed that the letter was from an orphanage near paddington in london. the orphanage had run out of money to support the children of sailors who had died in the service of their country. st vincent solicited from each captain and lieutenant a sum of money and then added his own donation. the cutter sailed back to england the same evening. st vincent gave the orphanage £1,000  st vincent's skills as an administrator and logistician came into play and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. st vincent wrote to earl spencer, commenting ""i have ever considered the care of the sick and wounded as one of the first duties of a commander-in-chief, by sea or land."" based on doctor baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of fresh lemon juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. the effect was dramatic. the hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in november 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. in a letter to sir evan nepean, first secretary to the admiralty, st vincent described baird as ""the most valuable man in the navy not excepting the board itself,"" the oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at torre abbey overlooking torbay. vice-admiral sir henry harvey took over operational command of the fleet in st vincent's absence.  in 1801 in a letter to the board of admiralty, st vincent made the now famous remark: ""i do not say, my lords, that the french will not come. i say only they will not come by sea."" in 1801 st vincent was replaced by admiral william cornwallis and the new prime minister henry addington promoted st vincent to first lord of the admiralty.   in january 1801 st vincent had written a short letter to the then first lord earl spencer stating: ""nothing short of a radical sweep in the dockyards can cure the enormous evils and corruptions in them; and this cannot be attempted till we have peace."" as first lord st vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the navy, the royal dockyards and their civilian administration. consequently, he clashed with the various navy boards, the civil administration of the royal navy that administered among other things the navy yards and stores. st vincent saw these boards and individuals as hindering the efforts of the navy.  during the peace with france, after the treaty of amiens was signed on 25 march 1802, st vincent ordered the navy board to begin an investigation for fraud and corruption in the royal dockyards. he swiftly found that the investigations were not being conducted effectively and ordered the commissioners to retrieve all logs and accounts and inventories and put them under their ""personal seal"" in anticipation of the admiralty board travelling to the various yards itself and conducting their own inspection. the investigation began in earnest in 1802. st vincent swiftly uncovered casual and obvious abuses of the system. some men were listed as having done work, then over-time and then acted as night watchmen for years without a break of any kind. others were listed as workmen ashore but also as sailors receiving pay in the receiving ship. work was done and then the identical work was charged for over various periods, often by different departments or sections. in another yard, ""the men of an entire department were found to be incapables, as old, infirm boys, cripples, or idiots, and the department itself to have the appearance of an asylum for every rogue and vagabond that could not obtain a meal by any other means."" st vincent found that minor dockyard officials were the tip of a far bigger corruption. he lobbied the government to create a special commission of inquiry that would have the power to question suspects under oath. the cabinet determined that the outcome of such an inquiry might be damaging politically (and possibly in some cases, personally) and gave the board of inquiry permission to question suspects under oath but gave the suspects the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate themselves. this addendum removed the ability of the inquiry to act effectively in any way. the commission of inquiry produced twelve reports:   one of st vincent's biographers put the findings of the commission succinctly ""the valuable british oak rotted in the forests for want of the axe; the frames building rotted on the stocks for want of timber; the ships at sea rotted before their day because constructed of such worthless perishable materials.""   one reform st vincent did achieve was the introduction of block making machinery at the navy yard in portsmouth. the machinery was designed by marc isambard brunel and samuel bentham. by 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. the innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost of the project was recovered in three years. the revolution of machinery enabled the navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. this self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. the buildings that housed the block machinery remain to this day and make up part of the historic portsmouth dockyard.  as first lord, st vincent also determined to build a breakwater in plymouth. the first lord commissioned a civil engineer, john rennie, and joseph whidbey, the former master-attendant at woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.  st vincent spoke with the king regarding the contribution made by marines to the general service of the navy and recommended to the king that the prefix ""royal"" be added. these were the first official discussions into the retitling of the corps to royal marines.  during his tenure, the workers in the royal dockyards demanded an increase in pay due to an increase in living costs. st vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken an active role in the strike. he eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.  st vincent's gaze passed over every aspect of the navy from the sea fencibles to the navy hospitals. the earl attempted to disband the sea fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. doctor baird, st vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the sick and hurt board as inspector of all hospitals.  another burden of his promotion to first lord of the admiralty was that st vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers and their relatives and friends. soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. the more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. also, due to the peace with france the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. the first lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. despite st vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the admiralty.  the ways in which st vincent chose to communicate the rejections often depended on the number of letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. to the earl of portsmouth he wrote: ""i cannot possibly agree in opinion with your lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime."" a harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: ""although i cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of captain (name unknown) ""[sic.]"", there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which i lose no time in acknowledging;""  famously, when commander lord cochrane captured the 32-gun spanish frigate ""el gamo"" in the 14-gun sloop a promotion was the usual reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. it would be fair to argue that it would have been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. unfortunately for cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the french and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. a court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including cochrane's, it was only a formality. it was only when cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. unfortunately the commander thought that the first lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. these solicitations may have had a negative effect on cochrane's career as it is possible that jervis became irritated by them.  the detailed investigation into corruption that st vincent began caused him to become extremely unpopular as many influential men were involved in the various money making schemes perpetrated. the board of inquiry set up by st vincent was responsible for the impeachment of henry dundas, 1st viscount melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. st vincent had made an enemy of pitt and pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the first lord and the addington administration. st vincent left the office on 14 may 1804 when addington was replaced as prime minister by pitt. lord howick, second son of st vincent's friend sir charles grey came to his defence and with the assistance of charles james fox moved for a vote of thanks in the commons for st vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.  on 14 may 1806, john jeffery, one of the members of parliament for poole, opened a parliamentary debate condemning st vincent for ""unprecedented neglect in building and repairing of ships while his lordship presided at the board of admiralty and with delivering up the navy to his successor in a far less efficient state than that in which he received it"". this motion was rejected and instead the foreign secretary, charles james fox, proposed a vote of thanks to earl st vincent, ""that it appears to this house, that the conduct of the earl of st. vincent, in his late naval administration, has added an additional lustre to his exalted character, and is entitled to the approbation of this house.""  fox had said of st vincent's appointment in 1801 ""allow me to say, that i do not think it would be easy, if possible, to find a man in the whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person at the head of the admiralty – i mean the earl of st vincent."" and had continued his support of the earl throughout his time as first lord.  on 9 november 1805 st vincent was promoted admiral of the red. he took command of the channel fleet once more in the 110-gun first-rate . during his tenure in command he spent much of his time at a house that he rented in the village of rame. once again he issued the orders that had become so effective in the mediterranean and his previous channel command. once again these orders proved unpopular. for a short time in 1806 he gave command of the channel fleet to his second-in-command sir charles cotton in order that he might travel to portugal on a particular mission. portugal was under threat of invasion and st vincent had been ordered, if necessary, to take the portuguese court to its colony in brazil. the invasion of portugal was delayed and st vincent was recalled to the channel fleet. it was sir sidney smith and graham moore who led the royal family to safety in brazil. st vincent had long suffered from poor health and a change in government led to his resignation on 24 april 1807.  the earl had always attempted to promote on merit rather than patronage and had become increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. at his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the king. the king asked if the navy were a better institution now than it had been on st vincent's entrance into it. st vincent replied that it was not. he stated: ""sire i have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of members of parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on."" he continued on ""i would rather promote the son of an old deserving officer than of any noble in the land."" in a letter dated 18 october 1806 to viscount howick, then the first lord. ""if you will, my good lord, bring a bill into parliament to disqualify any officer under the rank of rear-admiral to sit in the house of commons, the navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than i possess to command your fleets."" presumably st vincent was referring to a particular member of parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.  in his retirement he seldom took his seat in the house of lords and made his last appearance in either 1810 or 1811. during these final years st vincent gave generously to various charities, organisations and individuals. he donated £500 to the wounded and survivors of the battle of waterloo and £300 to relieve starvation in ireland. st vincent also donated £100 to the building of a jewish chapel in whitechapel, london. in 1807 st vincent, as a member of the house of lords, opposed a bill to abolish the slave trade. his motives appear to have been practical rather than humanitarian or otherwise. st vincent argued that if britain were to ban the trade it would simply be continued by other countries and thereby britain would lose the revenue generated and be weakened accordingly. st vincent spoke in opposition to the convention of sintra he spoke against the walcheren campaign and then condemned its failure, although conspicuously excluded the failure of its officers and men. st vincent spoke in defence of lieutenant-general sir john moore's retreat through spain and portugal and condemned the government and army commanders for failure to support him thoroughly. in 1816 his wife martha died at rochetts in essex. the couple had no children. in the winter of 1818–1819 st vincent went to recover his health in france. when he arrived at toulon he was greeted by admiral édouard missiessy who said of st vincent that he was: ""as much the father of the french as of the english navy"".  in 1800 st vincent was made an honorary lieutenant-general of marines and in 1814 was promoted to general. these positions were little more than a sinecure and carried no official duties. in 1801 st vincent had been created viscount st vincent of meaford, staffordshire. a title that because he had no children passed to his nephew, edward jervis ricketts. in 1806 he was appointed as one of the thirty one elder brothers of trinity house. the elder brothers, along with the master, form the court of trinity house. in 1809 st vincent was honoured by john vi of portugal who awarded him the royal portuguese military order of the tower and sword in order to commemorate the safe arrival of the royal family in brazil, after napoleon had invaded portugal. in may 1814 he was promoted acting admiral of the fleet and commander-in-chief of the channel squadron. he was confirmed admiral of the fleet on 19 july 1821 and george iv sent him a gold topped baton as a symbol of the office. the baton is currently held in the collections of the national maritime museum, greenwich. on 2 january 1815 he was made knight grand cross of the order of the bath when the order was rearranged by the prince regent. the knight grand cross is the highest rank in the order.  st vincent died on 13 march 1823 and, because he had no children, the barony of jervis and the earldom of st vincent became extinct. his nephew, edward jervis ricketts, became the 2nd viscount st vincent and changed his surname to jervis, becoming edward jervis jervis in honour of his uncle. st vincent was buried at stone, staffordshire, in the family mausoleum, at his own request and a monument was erected in the crypt of st. paul's cathedral.  at least three ships and two stone frigates (or shore establishments) have been named either in honour of the earl or after that battle that he won. , commissioned in 1910, was the first of her class and therefore the class of battleship was named after her. the ""st. vincent""–class battleships included and . , a j-class destroyer, launched just prior to the second world war, was named after the admiral. hms ""jervis"" served throughout the war. she was known as a lucky ship as, despite taking part in several actions, she never lost a man to enemy fire. hms ""jervis bay"", an armed merchant cruiser that was lost in heroic circumstances, was indirectly named after him.  jervis has also been remembered in schools in england. he has a boarding house (saint vincent) named in his honour at the royal hospital school. st vincent college in gosport, england is named after the admiral's most famous battle.  as with many other officers during the great age of discovery there are several areas of the world named in the earl's honour. cape jervis and gulf st vincent, south australia, and jervis bay, new south wales, australia were named for him as was the town of vincentia and jervis bay national park. the county of st vincent, new south wales was also named in his honour. jervis inlet, in british columbia, canada, was also named for him.  though jervis clearly had a strong impact during the napoleonic wars and afterwards on the development of the navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of jervis are available, and those are seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. the most recent work related to jervis is ""the remaking of the english navy by admiral st. vincent: the great unclaimed naval revolution"" by charles arthur, 1986, but this focused more on jervis's reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. evelyn berkman's ""nelson's dear lord: portrait of st. vincent"" (1962), as the bibliographer eugene rasor points out, is merely an ""effort"" to create a biography. the same bibliographer says much the same about william milbourne james's """"old oak"": the life of john jervis, earl st. vincent"" (1950) and owen sherrard's ""a life of lord st. vincent"" (1933), pointing to both as mediocre. ruddock mackay published an article which documented the early life of jervis.","3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2","3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3"
84,German,"by the end of 1763 'gosport' disbursed and jervis remained unemployed until february 1769 when he was appointed on the 32-gun, the first coppered warship of the royal navy.","admiral of the fleet john jervis, 1st earl of st vincent (9 january 1735 – 14 march 1823) was an admiral in the royal navy and member of parliament in the united kingdom. jervis served throughout the latter half of the 18th century and into the 19th, and was an active commander during the seven years' war, american war of independence, french revolutionary war and the napoleonic wars. he is best known for his victory at the 1797 battle of cape saint vincent, from which he earned his titles, and as a patron of horatio nelson.  jervis was also recognised by both political and military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. as commander-in-chief of the mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. he applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy that made him a controversial figure. he took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the channel fleet in 1799. in 1801, as first lord of the admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. he introduced innovations including block making machinery at portsmouth royal dockyard. st vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.  jervis' entry in the ""oxford dictionary of national biography"" by p. k. crimmin describes his contribution to history: ""his importance lies in his being the organiser of victories; the creator of well-equipped, highly efficient fleets; and in training a school of officers as professional, energetic, and devoted to the service as himself.""  john jervis was born in meaford, staffordshire, on 9 january 1735, the second son of swynfen and elizabeth jervis. his father was a barrister, counsellor to the admiralty board and auditor of greenwich hospital.<ref name=""nc02/1"">""the naval chronicle"" vol. 4, pp. 2–3.</ref> swynfen jervis intended that his son should follow him to the bar. the young jervis was educated at burton-upon-trent grammar school and subsequently at reverend swinden's academy in greenwich, london.  their family name jervis is pronounced 'jarviss'. the name jervis originates from the norman name gervase.  at the age of thirteen jervis ran away and joined the navy at woolwich, london. after a short time he returned home as he had heard his family were very upset at his disappearance. lady jane hamilton (mother of sir william hamilton) and lady burlington became aware of jervis' desire to join the navy and lobbied his family on his behalf. eventually they introduced the jervis family to admiral george townshend who agreed to take the boy aboard one of his ships.  on 4 january 1749 jervis entered the navy as an able seaman aboard the 50-gun on her way to jamaica. on arrival in the west indies, jervis was detached on hm sloop to the mosquito coast where he saw constant service against spanish guarda-costas and privateers. when townshend quit the west indies he discharged jervis into the under admiral thomas cotes. cotes' flag captain henry dennis rated jervis as a midshipman. on 31 july 1754 jervis moved to the 24-gun . jervis commented in a letter to his sister: ""my chief employ when from my duty is reading studying navigation and perusing my old letters of which i have almost enough to make an octavo volume."" while in jamaica, the young jervis drew funds against his father's account with a local banker. when the reply came from england that the withdrawal could not be honoured, the midshipman found himself in debt. jervis was forced to quit his mess and live on ship's rations in order to pay off the loan. the event deeply affected the young jervis who swore never to ""draw another bill without the certainty of it being paid"". ""sphinx"" was paid off at spithead on 7 november 1754. jervis was assigned to the 20-gun in december of the same year and then from the end of december until february 1755 was assigned to hm yacht ""william and mary"" under the navigational expert captain john campbell.  jervis passed his lieutenant's examination on 2 january 1755 and was assigned as sixth lieutenant to the first-rate of 100 guns. by march, he had moved to third lieutenant of the 60-gun . the ""nottingham"" was part of edward boscawen's fleet that attempted to prevent french reinforcements reaching new france. on 31 march 1756 jervis moved to the 74-gun hms and on 22 june he was promoted to be fourth lieutenant of the 90-gun ""prince"" under captain charles saunders in the mediterranean. when the captain was promoted to admiral, jervis followed him to the 74-gun in november 1756. in january 1757 jervis was promoted to temporary command of . in her, he fought a large french privateer in an indecisive action off cape gata. when the captain of the ""experiment"" regained his health jervis moved back to the ""culloden"". in june 1757, he followed saunders to the 90-gun hms ""st george"". jervis returned to england in temporary command of the 80-gun , a ship that had been captured by henry osborn's fleet at the battle of cartagena. he followed saunders once more when the admiral was promoted to command the north american station; jervis was promoted to lieutenant of hms ""prince"".  the fleet, part of an expedition to capture the french possessions in north america, left england in february 1759. they stopped first at louisbourg, which had been captured from the french the previous year. by june, the ice along the saint lawrence river had broken up and the fleet along with the military transports headed up river to the assault of quebec city. on 15 may 1759, jervis had been promoted acting commander of the sloop . in this command jervis impressed general james wolfe in the preparations that led to the battle of the plains of abraham. ""porcupine"" and the frigate led the armed transports past quebec to land up river. one biographer, jedediah tucker, notes that as the approach was so critical, both wolfe and the subsequently famous james cook boarded the ""porcupine"" to ensure the success of the mission.  for his efforts jervis was promoted commander and took command of . jervis returned to england in september but immediately returned to north america in command of the ""albany"". in may 1760 jervis was attached to admiral sir george rodney's channel squadron.  in october 1760 he was made post-captain in command of the 44-gun . ""gosport"" had on board a young midshipman, george elphinstone, later viscount keith, who took over jervis' command in the mediterranean after jervis' departure in 1799. in 1762, hms ""gosport"", and under captain joshua rowley, convoyed the east and west indian trade to the westward, and successfully protected it from the squadron of commodore de ternay.","he was tasked with delivering bullion to the english merchants in genoa. during his time in genoa two turkish slaves escaped a genoese galley and hid aboard one of ""alarm"" boats. they were forcibly removed; jervis made an official protest and promised retaliation if they were not handed over. the slaves were produced and jervis took custody of them.  on 30 march 1770 the ""alarm"" was driven ashore off marseilles but with the efforts of jervis, the crew and the local french authorities under the governor of marseilles, georges rené le peley de pléville she was brought off and repaired. jervis personally returned to marseilles with a letter of thanks from the board of the admiralty to the governor for his assistance.  in 1771 ""alarm"" returned to england to collect the duke of gloucester, king george iii's brother in order that he could winter in italy. he lived aboard with his entourage until may 1772 when ""alarm"" returned to england and was paid off.  between october 1772 and june 1775, jervis travelled extensively. he began in france where he studied the language and made observations about french life. he accompanied captain samuel barrington to russia where they spent time in saint petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at kronstadt and took a tour of the yacht designed by sir charles knowles for catherine of russia. the pair continued on to sweden, denmark and northern germany. all the while jervis made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. they came home via the netherlands, jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. he and barrington then took a private cruise along the channel coast calling at various harbours including brest, making and improving their charts as they went. when jervis later became the commander-in-chief of the channel fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of brest by these charts. in later years, he commented: ""had the young captain jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the earl st vincent would not have been able to effect such a thorough blockade of it.""  at the outbreak of the american war of independence in 1775 jervis was given the command of ; however, she was surveyed by the dockyard and found unfit for service. he was therefore appointed instead to command of hms ""foudroyant"", the ship he had brought to england as a prize seventeen years earlier. for the first few years of the war, the french supplied arms, funding, and military advice on an informal and limited basis to the newly emerging nation of america. with the signing of the treaty of alliance in 1778 and the creation of the franco-american alliance, the war widened. jervis spent the first few years of the war patrolling the channel in ""foudroyant"" without seeing any significant action, but as the war reached europe jervis was placed under the command of admiral augustus keppel. the channel fleet, under keppel, sighted the french fleet intending to enter brest on 23 july. the british fleet of 30 ships of the line chased the french fleet of 29 ships and engaged them on 27 july in what became known as the first battle of ushant. the battle was indecisive and in the political aftermath jervis provided a stalwart defence of admiral keppel at the latter's court-martial, helping to secure keppel's acquittal.  jervis remained in ""foudroyant"" attached to the channel fleet and for a short time acted as flag captain to admiral molyneux shuldham. in 1780 jervis was with admiral rodney when the british fleet relieved gibraltar. in 1781 he was with admiral george darby at the second relief of gibraltar. on 19 april 1782 jervis was with his old friend and travelling companion when a ship in admiral barrington's squadron sighted a french convoy leaving brest. the squadron gave chase and ""foudroyant"" caught and engaged the french 74-gun ""pégase"". after an engagement of more than an hour ""pégase"" struck. jervis himself was wounded in the attack. for his services he was invested as a knight of the bath on 19 may 1782. he was again at the relief of gibraltar with earl howe's fleet in 1782 and took part in the indecisive battle of cape spartel. jervis was promoted commodore and hoisted his broad pennant in the 50-gun in december 1782, with orders to proceed to the west indies. due to the peace negotiations his orders were rescinded and he struck his pennant on 14 january 1783.  during the peace jervis married his cousin martha, daughter of lord chief baron sir thomas parker. jervis was also returned as mp for launceston in 1783. jervis began his political career in earnest and voted for pitt's parliamentary reforms and against charles james fox and his east india bill. during the elections of 1784 jervis stood for election in the independent borough of great yarmouth where he was returned as mp alongside henry beaufoy. jervis then voted against pitt's further bills for reform but supported him once more during the 1788–1799 regency crisis.  on 24 september 1787 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the blue and hoisted his flag in the 74-gun ""carnatic"" for several months during the tensions arising from the prussian invasion of the netherlands. in 1790 jervis was recalled to service once more and moved his flag to the second-rate ""prince"" during the nootka sound crisis that threatened war between england and spain. also in 1790 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the white and stood down as mp for great yarmouth and stood instead for the chipping wycombe seat to which he was returned as mp alongside the earl wycombe. with his interest in politics wavering he spoke rarely and then almost exclusively on naval matters. in 1794 he resigned his seat and did not stand again for political office. in 1792 jervis proposed a scheme to alleviate the financial hardship of superannuated seamen. he later withdrew the proposal as viscount melville promised that the matter would be addressed by the admiralty board.  jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the blue and was appointed to command of the leeward islands station. jervis took with him an army that, combined with the navy, formed a joint military expedition. the goal of the expedition was to capture french colonies and thereby weaken france's international trade. the army commander was sir charles grey, a friend and political ally. jervis hoisted his flag in . he took grey's son, captain george grey, later sir george grey, 1st baronet, as his flag-captain. the combined forces captured the french colonies of martinique, guadeloupe and saint lucia and restored monarchist rule.  the french counter-attacked and recaptured guadeloupe on 2 june 1794. jervis and grey landed a force to recapture the island but were repulsed by the reinforced french garrison and the british expedition withdrew. in november 1794 admiral benjamin caldwell replaced jervis. disputes over prize money were widely held as the reason that jervis and grey were not awarded peerages for their service. grey and jervis' enemies proposed a vote of censure against the general and admiral. the vote itself was negative. the prize money for the capture of the three islands, when finally calculated, amounted to £70,000 that was due to the officers and men of the navy. if adjusted for inflation this would equal approximately £ as of 20. jervis and grey were however awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament for their services. on 12 april 1794 jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the white.  jervis was promoted admiral of the blue on 1 june 1795 and appointed to command the mediterranean fleet. unfortunately the ""boyne"" had caught fire on 1 may 1795 and had blown up in spithead, the result of an accident, and jervis lost almost all of his possessions. jervis went to take command of the mediterranean fleet in the frigate and once more took charles grey's son, captain george grey, as his flag-captain. jervis also took robert calder as his captain of the fleet. on arrival at gibraltar jervis took as his flagship. among jervis' subordinates were captains horatio nelson, cuthbert collingwood and thomas troubridge. jervis began a close blockade of toulon and nelson was assigned the task of aiding the austrian army along the italian coast. by september 1796 the british presence in the mediterranean had become untenable. napoleon had beaten britain's austrian allies who were in disarray and, in october, spain had surrendered and allied themselves to the french. jervis recalled admiral robert mann to aid in the blockade of cadiz. mann took his ships instead to spithead. jervis abandoned corsica between september and november 1796 and withdrew his forces to gibraltar. a spanish fleet made up of twenty four line-of-battle ships and seven frigates sailed from toulon on 1 february 1797. jervis' fleet of ten ships-of-the-line was patrolling off cape saint vincent and was subsequently joined by five more under sir william parker. the spanish admiral, josé de córdoba, had taken his ships into the atlantic to weather a storm and was making his way to cadiz when the two fleets caught sight of each other.  the british and spanish fleet sighted one another at dawn on 14 february 1797. the british fleet had fifteen line-of-battle ships against the twenty four spanish ships. on the quarter-deck of ""victory"", jervis and his flag captain, robert calder counted the ships. it was at this point jervis discovered that he was outnumbered nearly two-to-one: ""there are eight sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty five sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty seven sail of the line, sir john"" ""enough, sir, no more of that; the die is cast, and if there are fifty sail i will go through them."" a passenger aboard ""victory"", captain benjamin hallowell, achieved a brief notoriety for slapping the admiral on the back and calling out ""that's right sir john, that's right. by god, we shall give them a damned good licking!""  during the battle nelson, in command of , wore out of line and performed a stunning feat by capturing two of the enemy vessels within moments. nelson and his crew boarded and captured one and crossed her deck and boarded and captured the second, which had collided in the smoke and general melee of the battle. the move was later feted by the public and press and dubbed """"nelson's patent bridge for boarding first-rates""."" when the spanish retreated jervis did not press his advantage but consolidated his victory and began the lengthy job of repairing both his ships and crews. the british had suffered casualties of 73 killed and 227 wounded.  sir john did not mention nelson's achievement in his initial despatch to the admiralty despite nelson's obvious contribution to the success of the battle. in later despatches jervis did mention nelson. in one anecdote, when discussing the battle with his flag-captain, sir robert, who had been mentioned in the despatch and had been awarded a knighthood for his services, brought up the issue of nelson's disobedience of the admiral's orders for having worn out of the line of battle in order to engage the enemy. jervis silenced him by saying: ""it certainly was so, and if you ever commit such a breach of your orders, i will forgive you also.""  despite the capture of only four vessels, the battle of cape saint vincent became celebrated as an outstanding victory and the awards and recognition far outweighed the achievement. the bad news of the evacuation of the mediterranean, the capitulation of the spanish and the italian city-states and the defeat of the austrian army alongside the increasing threat of a french invasion of britain had depressed the politicians and general public. a victory, such as that of cape saint vincent, was more important for the morale of the country as a whole than its military ramifications. both jervis and nelson were hailed as heroes and jervis was made baron jervis of meaford and earl st vincent. songs were written about jervis and the battle and there was a general feeling of relief in both the government and people of britain. nelson for his services was invested as a knight of the bath. the now earl st vincent was gifted a pension for life of £3,000 per year. the city of london had already presented him with the freedom of the city in a gold box valued at 100 guineas for his success in the west indies and for this battle awarded him a presentation sword. the presentation box and sword are both currently held at the national maritime museum, greenwich. nelson was also awarded his freedom of the city of london for the battle of cape st vincent, and was to get a presentation sword for the nile. the sword awarded to jervis was the first of their kind that the city of london issued. st vincent was awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament and given a gold medal by the king. the ""london gazette"" published an advertisement in 1798 regarding the prize money that was due to the officers and men who had fought at the battle. the sum quoted was £140,000, in inflationary terms this would be approximately £ as of 20, of which, as admiral, jervis was entitled to a sizeable share. jervis resumed his blockade of the spanish fleet in cadiz.  during 1797 there was considerable discontent among the seamen of the royal navy. this discontent manifested itself at the nore and at spithead when the greater part of the channel fleet rose up against their officers. these mutinies were not overly violent and the officers were put ashore and the heads of the mutinies established their own order and kept the ships under ""committee"" control until their collective demands were met. the mutineers demands ranged from discontent at cruel officers to poor pay and long sea service without shore leave. there were other mutinies throughout the navy that year, most notably and both on the jamaica station. these mutinies resulted in the crews killing their officers and taking their ships into enemy held ports.  jervis had the reputation as a disciplinarian and put in place a new system that would ensure that the men in the mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. to begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. for example, jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.  jervis discouraged conversation in irish though he did not ban it. he ordered the marine detachments to be paraded every morning and, if there was a band available, for ""god save the king"" to be played. the marine detachment was then to remain armed at all times. marines and soldiers were also excused from duties in regard to the general running of the ship.  in order to keep his crews active and to ensure that the spanish did not perceive that there might be discontent in the fleet, jervis ordered the nightly bombardment of cadiz in his own words to ""divert the animal.""  the admiral isolated the ships from one another to minimise collusion and the opportunities the men might have to band together in mutiny. st vincent did ensure, however, that the men under his command were cared for. when the stock of tobacco ran low the admiral ensured that the supply was renewed from his own funds. when the postmaster in lisbon detained the letters and packets arriving from england for the men for fear that they would carry seditious communications, jervis set up a post office aboard his flagship to receive and distribute all the letters that arrived for both seamen, marines and officers.  jervis strictly adhered to the articles of war and individual regulations that he had written for his fleet. any infraction was dealt with harshly and he was renowned for treating both officers and seamen with the same harsh discipline. as an example, one officer who allowed his boats crew to plunder a fishing boat was placed before a court martial and it was ordered that he be ""degraded from the rank of midshipman in the most ignominious manner by having his uniform stripped from his back on the quarter deck of the (ship unknown)""[sic]"". before the whole ship's company and to be further disposed of as the commander-in-chief shall direct. to be mulcted of his pay now due to him for his services on board any ship of his majesty's service and to be rendered incapable of ever serving as an officer or a petty officer in any of his majesty's ships."" jervis later personally directed that the midshipman should have his head shaved, a notice hung around his neck describing his crime and that he should be solely responsible for the cleaning of the head (naval term for the communal toilets situated at the bow of the ship) until further notice. in another incident, st vincent instructed that two men aboard who were tried for mutiny on a saturday were executed on sunday. the men were duly executed but admiral charles thompson raised an objection to formal executions on the sabbath and jervis wrote to the board of admiralty demanding thompson's removal or that they accept his own resignation. the board relieved thompson. on 9 july 1797 nelson wrote to jervis congratulating him in his resolve and wholeheartedly supporting his decision to execute the men on a sunday.  jervis could also be exceptionally kind when he felt that the situation warranted it. on one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. the men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. one of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. in one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. the bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. the admiral saw the man and asked the problem. one of his officers told him and st vincent went to his cabin. when he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. ""roger odell you are convicted, sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the british oak with tears. what have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?"" the man told him what had happened and st vincent replied ""roger odell you are one of the best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life i never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the victory in the action with the spanish fleet. to show therefore that your commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. there is your money sir!"" the earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor ""but no more tears mind, no more tears sir"".  when nelson returned to the mediterranean st vincent wrote to earl spencer, first lord of the admiralty: ""i do assure your lordship that the arrival of admiral nelson has given me new life; you could not have gratified me more than in sending him. his presence in the mediterranean is so very essential."" st vincent detached nelson to pursue napoleon in his invasion of egypt rear-admiral sir john orde who was senior to nelson complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight. jervis ordered orde home. orde requested that he be court-martialled in order that he might have the opportunity to clear his name. the board refused. orde then requested that st vincent be brought before a court-martial. again, the board refused. the board censured jervis for not having supported his subordinates. orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. the challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered jervis to decline. before the challenge was formally declined, orde wrote to the board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.  when the men aboard the refused to execute a man for mutinous behaviour and their captain did nothing, the earl threatened the captain with replacement and had boats from the rest of the fleet armed with carronades surround the ""marlborough""; he then threatened to sink the ship if his orders were not carried out. the man was duly executed. st vincent turned to an officer beside him watching the mutineer hanging from the yard arm and said ""discipline is preserved, sir!""  between 1797 and 1799 alongside the suppression of mutiny jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of gibraltar including building a new victualling yard and water tanks to replenish his ships. after the battle of the nile the dockyards, under jervis' watchful eye, managed to successfully repair most of the fleet. lady lavinia bingham, wife of earl spencer wrote to st vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the nile. ""never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward than yours has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend."" nelson commented that he had ""never beheld a fleet equal to sir john jervis'"" having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water the admiral arranged for large tanks to be built in gibraltar. on 14 february 1799 st vincent was created admiral of the white. constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. despite his failing health, st vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the board reluctant to supersede him. by 17 june 1799 he had no choice but to resign his command and return to england. during his time ashore the earl lived in rochetts, essex with his wife.  as his health had improved he was given command of the channel fleet. st vincent was to comment ""the king and the government require it and the discipline of the british navy demands it. it is of no consequence to me whether i die afloat or ashore. the die is cast.""  he took command of the channel fleet in on 26 april 1800 and took up a close blockade of brest. once at brest he transferred to the ""ville de paris"" of 110 guns and took sir thomas troubridge as his captain of the fleet. he was also accompanied by his personal physician, doctor andrew baird. baird was later to become instrumental in the plans of the commander-in-chief and the health and well being of the channel fleet.  st vincent's appointment was not popular among the officers of the channel fleet. his reputation as a strict disciplinarian had followed him from the mediterranean and he immediately issued orders banning officers and captains from sleeping ashore and forbade them from travelling more than three miles from their ship. among other strict regulations introduced were orders that ships were to be repaired where possible at sea and that ushant was to be the official rendezvous for the channel fleet rather than the traditional torbay. the wife of one of his captains is said to have toasted the news of his appointment with the line ""may his next glass of wine choke the wretch."" ships were forbidden to go to spithead without specific written orders from the admiral or admiralty. during his command he remained with the fleet and became respected by the officers and men for suffering their hardships with them.  with the charts that he had made with barrington in 1775 the inshore squadron at brest was able to keep a much tighter blockade. in one incident, the inshore squadron sighted several french ships leaving brest. sir edward pellew, captain of hms ""impétueux"", gave chase. the rear admiral in charge of the inshore squadron recalled him, worried that the ""impétueux"" would run aground. the french escaped. after several letters went back and forth between the two admirals, st vincent, tired of his subordinate's excuses, took the entire offshore squadron and sailed them between the inshore squadron and the shore thus proving that the ships had a shallow enough draught to have given chase and captured the french. st vincent then wrote to the rear admiral and suggested that he strike his flag and return to shore for some needed rest.  st vincent was as generous in the channel as he had been in the mediterranean. a particular letter from england made the admiral host a dinner aboard the flagship for fifty of the officers whom he felt closest to. at the dinner he revealed that the letter was from an orphanage near paddington in london. the orphanage had run out of money to support the children of sailors who had died in the service of their country. st vincent solicited from each captain and lieutenant a sum of money and then added his own donation. the cutter sailed back to england the same evening. st vincent gave the orphanage £1,000  st vincent's skills as an administrator and logistician came into play and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. st vincent wrote to earl spencer, commenting ""i have ever considered the care of the sick and wounded as one of the first duties of a commander-in-chief, by sea or land."" based on doctor baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of fresh lemon juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. the effect was dramatic. the hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in november 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. in a letter to sir evan nepean, first secretary to the admiralty, st vincent described baird as ""the most valuable man in the navy not excepting the board itself,"" the oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at torre abbey overlooking torbay. vice-admiral sir henry harvey took over operational command of the fleet in st vincent's absence.  in 1801 in a letter to the board of admiralty, st vincent made the now famous remark: ""i do not say, my lords, that the french will not come. i say only they will not come by sea."" in 1801 st vincent was replaced by admiral william cornwallis and the new prime minister henry addington promoted st vincent to first lord of the admiralty.   in january 1801 st vincent had written a short letter to the then first lord earl spencer stating: ""nothing short of a radical sweep in the dockyards can cure the enormous evils and corruptions in them; and this cannot be attempted till we have peace."" as first lord st vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the navy, the royal dockyards and their civilian administration. consequently, he clashed with the various navy boards, the civil administration of the royal navy that administered among other things the navy yards and stores. st vincent saw these boards and individuals as hindering the efforts of the navy.  during the peace with france, after the treaty of amiens was signed on 25 march 1802, st vincent ordered the navy board to begin an investigation for fraud and corruption in the royal dockyards. he swiftly found that the investigations were not being conducted effectively and ordered the commissioners to retrieve all logs and accounts and inventories and put them under their ""personal seal"" in anticipation of the admiralty board travelling to the various yards itself and conducting their own inspection. the investigation began in earnest in 1802. st vincent swiftly uncovered casual and obvious abuses of the system. some men were listed as having done work, then over-time and then acted as night watchmen for years without a break of any kind. others were listed as workmen ashore but also as sailors receiving pay in the receiving ship. work was done and then the identical work was charged for over various periods, often by different departments or sections. in another yard, ""the men of an entire department were found to be incapables, as old, infirm boys, cripples, or idiots, and the department itself to have the appearance of an asylum for every rogue and vagabond that could not obtain a meal by any other means."" st vincent found that minor dockyard officials were the tip of a far bigger corruption. he lobbied the government to create a special commission of inquiry that would have the power to question suspects under oath. the cabinet determined that the outcome of such an inquiry might be damaging politically (and possibly in some cases, personally) and gave the board of inquiry permission to question suspects under oath but gave the suspects the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate themselves. this addendum removed the ability of the inquiry to act effectively in any way. the commission of inquiry produced twelve reports:   one of st vincent's biographers put the findings of the commission succinctly ""the valuable british oak rotted in the forests for want of the axe; the frames building rotted on the stocks for want of timber; the ships at sea rotted before their day because constructed of such worthless perishable materials.""   one reform st vincent did achieve was the introduction of block making machinery at the navy yard in portsmouth. the machinery was designed by marc isambard brunel and samuel bentham. by 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. the innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost of the project was recovered in three years. the revolution of machinery enabled the navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. this self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. the buildings that housed the block machinery remain to this day and make up part of the historic portsmouth dockyard.  as first lord, st vincent also determined to build a breakwater in plymouth. the first lord commissioned a civil engineer, john rennie, and joseph whidbey, the former master-attendant at woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.  st vincent spoke with the king regarding the contribution made by marines to the general service of the navy and recommended to the king that the prefix ""royal"" be added. these were the first official discussions into the retitling of the corps to royal marines.  during his tenure, the workers in the royal dockyards demanded an increase in pay due to an increase in living costs. st vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken an active role in the strike. he eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.  st vincent's gaze passed over every aspect of the navy from the sea fencibles to the navy hospitals. the earl attempted to disband the sea fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. doctor baird, st vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the sick and hurt board as inspector of all hospitals.  another burden of his promotion to first lord of the admiralty was that st vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers and their relatives and friends. soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. the more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. also, due to the peace with france the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. the first lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. despite st vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the admiralty.  the ways in which st vincent chose to communicate the rejections often depended on the number of letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. to the earl of portsmouth he wrote: ""i cannot possibly agree in opinion with your lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime."" a harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: ""although i cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of captain (name unknown) ""[sic.]"", there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which i lose no time in acknowledging;""  famously, when commander lord cochrane captured the 32-gun spanish frigate ""el gamo"" in the 14-gun sloop a promotion was the usual reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. it would be fair to argue that it would have been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. unfortunately for cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the french and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. a court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including cochrane's, it was only a formality. it was only when cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. unfortunately the commander thought that the first lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. these solicitations may have had a negative effect on cochrane's career as it is possible that jervis became irritated by them.  the detailed investigation into corruption that st vincent began caused him to become extremely unpopular as many influential men were involved in the various money making schemes perpetrated. the board of inquiry set up by st vincent was responsible for the impeachment of henry dundas, 1st viscount melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. st vincent had made an enemy of pitt and pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the first lord and the addington administration. st vincent left the office on 14 may 1804 when addington was replaced as prime minister by pitt. lord howick, second son of st vincent's friend sir charles grey came to his defence and with the assistance of charles james fox moved for a vote of thanks in the commons for st vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.  on 14 may 1806, john jeffery, one of the members of parliament for poole, opened a parliamentary debate condemning st vincent for ""unprecedented neglect in building and repairing of ships while his lordship presided at the board of admiralty and with delivering up the navy to his successor in a far less efficient state than that in which he received it"". this motion was rejected and instead the foreign secretary, charles james fox, proposed a vote of thanks to earl st vincent, ""that it appears to this house, that the conduct of the earl of st. vincent, in his late naval administration, has added an additional lustre to his exalted character, and is entitled to the approbation of this house.""  fox had said of st vincent's appointment in 1801 ""allow me to say, that i do not think it would be easy, if possible, to find a man in the whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person at the head of the admiralty – i mean the earl of st vincent."" and had continued his support of the earl throughout his time as first lord.  on 9 november 1805 st vincent was promoted admiral of the red. he took command of the channel fleet once more in the 110-gun first-rate . during his tenure in command he spent much of his time at a house that he rented in the village of rame. once again he issued the orders that had become so effective in the mediterranean and his previous channel command. once again these orders proved unpopular. for a short time in 1806 he gave command of the channel fleet to his second-in-command sir charles cotton in order that he might travel to portugal on a particular mission. portugal was under threat of invasion and st vincent had been ordered, if necessary, to take the portuguese court to its colony in brazil. the invasion of portugal was delayed and st vincent was recalled to the channel fleet. it was sir sidney smith and graham moore who led the royal family to safety in brazil. st vincent had long suffered from poor health and a change in government led to his resignation on 24 april 1807.  the earl had always attempted to promote on merit rather than patronage and had become increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. at his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the king. the king asked if the navy were a better institution now than it had been on st vincent's entrance into it. st vincent replied that it was not. he stated: ""sire i have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of members of parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on."" he continued on ""i would rather promote the son of an old deserving officer than of any noble in the land."" in a letter dated 18 october 1806 to viscount howick, then the first lord. ""if you will, my good lord, bring a bill into parliament to disqualify any officer under the rank of rear-admiral to sit in the house of commons, the navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than i possess to command your fleets."" presumably st vincent was referring to a particular member of parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.  in his retirement he seldom took his seat in the house of lords and made his last appearance in either 1810 or 1811. during these final years st vincent gave generously to various charities, organisations and individuals. he donated £500 to the wounded and survivors of the battle of waterloo and £300 to relieve starvation in ireland. st vincent also donated £100 to the building of a jewish chapel in whitechapel, london. in 1807 st vincent, as a member of the house of lords, opposed a bill to abolish the slave trade. his motives appear to have been practical rather than humanitarian or otherwise. st vincent argued that if britain were to ban the trade it would simply be continued by other countries and thereby britain would lose the revenue generated and be weakened accordingly. st vincent spoke in opposition to the convention of sintra he spoke against the walcheren campaign and then condemned its failure, although conspicuously excluded the failure of its officers and men. st vincent spoke in defence of lieutenant-general sir john moore's retreat through spain and portugal and condemned the government and army commanders for failure to support him thoroughly. in 1816 his wife martha died at rochetts in essex. the couple had no children. in the winter of 1818–1819 st vincent went to recover his health in france. when he arrived at toulon he was greeted by admiral édouard missiessy who said of st vincent that he was: ""as much the father of the french as of the english navy"".  in 1800 st vincent was made an honorary lieutenant-general of marines and in 1814 was promoted to general. these positions were little more than a sinecure and carried no official duties. in 1801 st vincent had been created viscount st vincent of meaford, staffordshire. a title that because he had no children passed to his nephew, edward jervis ricketts. in 1806 he was appointed as one of the thirty one elder brothers of trinity house. the elder brothers, along with the master, form the court of trinity house. in 1809 st vincent was honoured by john vi of portugal who awarded him the royal portuguese military order of the tower and sword in order to commemorate the safe arrival of the royal family in brazil, after napoleon had invaded portugal. in may 1814 he was promoted acting admiral of the fleet and commander-in-chief of the channel squadron. he was confirmed admiral of the fleet on 19 july 1821 and george iv sent him a gold topped baton as a symbol of the office. the baton is currently held in the collections of the national maritime museum, greenwich. on 2 january 1815 he was made knight grand cross of the order of the bath when the order was rearranged by the prince regent. the knight grand cross is the highest rank in the order.  st vincent died on 13 march 1823 and, because he had no children, the barony of jervis and the earldom of st vincent became extinct. his nephew, edward jervis ricketts, became the 2nd viscount st vincent and changed his surname to jervis, becoming edward jervis jervis in honour of his uncle. st vincent was buried at stone, staffordshire, in the family mausoleum, at his own request and a monument was erected in the crypt of st. paul's cathedral.  at least three ships and two stone frigates (or shore establishments) have been named either in honour of the earl or after that battle that he won. , commissioned in 1910, was the first of her class and therefore the class of battleship was named after her. the ""st. vincent""–class battleships included and . , a j-class destroyer, launched just prior to the second world war, was named after the admiral. hms ""jervis"" served throughout the war. she was known as a lucky ship as, despite taking part in several actions, she never lost a man to enemy fire. hms ""jervis bay"", an armed merchant cruiser that was lost in heroic circumstances, was indirectly named after him.  jervis has also been remembered in schools in england. he has a boarding house (saint vincent) named in his honour at the royal hospital school. st vincent college in gosport, england is named after the admiral's most famous battle.  as with many other officers during the great age of discovery there are several areas of the world named in the earl's honour. cape jervis and gulf st vincent, south australia, and jervis bay, new south wales, australia were named for him as was the town of vincentia and jervis bay national park. the county of st vincent, new south wales was also named in his honour. jervis inlet, in british columbia, canada, was also named for him.  though jervis clearly had a strong impact during the napoleonic wars and afterwards on the development of the navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of jervis are available, and those are seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. the most recent work related to jervis is ""the remaking of the english navy by admiral st. vincent: the great unclaimed naval revolution"" by charles arthur, 1986, but this focused more on jervis's reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. evelyn berkman's ""nelson's dear lord: portrait of st. vincent"" (1962), as the bibliographer eugene rasor points out, is merely an ""effort"" to create a biography. the same bibliographer says much the same about william milbourne james's """"old oak"": the life of john jervis, earl st. vincent"" (1950) and owen sherrard's ""a

84,Spanish,"at the end of 1763 'gosport' has been worthwhile and jervis become unemployed until february 1769 when he was appointed the 32-gun, the first coppered ship of war in the royal navy.","admiral of the fleet john jervis, 1st earl of st vincent (9 january 1735 – 14 march 1823) was an admiral in the royal navy and member of parliament in the united kingdom. jervis served throughout the latter half of the 18th century and into the 19th, and was an active commander during the seven years' war, american war of independence, french revolutionary war and the napoleonic wars. he is best known for his victory at the 1797 battle of cape saint vincent, from which he earned his titles, and as a patron of horatio nelson.  jervis was also recognised by both political and military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. as commander-in-chief of the mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. he applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy that made him a controversial figure. he took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the channel fleet in 1799. in 1801, as first lord of the admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. he introduced innovations including block making machinery at portsmouth royal dockyard. st vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.  jervis' entry in the ""oxford dictionary of national biography"" by p. k. crimmin describes his contribution to history: ""his importance lies in his being the organiser of victories; the creator of well-equipped, highly efficient fleets; and in training a school of officers as professional, energetic, and devoted to the service as himself.""  john jervis was born in meaford, staffordshire, on 9 january 1735, the second son of swynfen and elizabeth jervis. his father was a barrister, counsellor to the admiralty board and auditor of greenwich hospital.<ref name=""nc02/1"">""the naval chronicle"" vol. 4, pp. 2–3.</ref> swynfen jervis intended that his son should follow him to the bar. the young jervis was educated at burton-upon-trent grammar school and subsequently at reverend swinden's academy in greenwich, london.  their family name jervis is pronounced 'jarviss'. the name jervis originates from the norman name gervase.  at the age of thirteen jervis ran away and joined the navy at woolwich, london. after a short time he returned home as he had heard his family were very upset at his disappearance. lady jane hamilton (mother of sir william hamilton) and lady burlington became aware of jervis' desire to join the navy and lobbied his family on his behalf. eventually they introduced the jervis family to admiral george townshend who agreed to take the boy aboard one of his ships.  on 4 january 1749 jervis entered the navy as an able seaman aboard the 50-gun on her way to jamaica. on arrival in the west indies, jervis was detached on hm sloop to the mosquito coast where he saw constant service against spanish guarda-costas and privateers. when townshend quit the west indies he discharged jervis into the under admiral thomas cotes. cotes' flag captain henry dennis rated jervis as a midshipman. on 31 july 1754 jervis moved to the 24-gun . jervis commented in a letter to his sister: ""my chief employ when from my duty is reading studying navigation and perusing my old letters of which i have almost enough to make an octavo volume."" while in jamaica, the young jervis drew funds against his father's account with a local banker. when the reply came from england that the withdrawal could not be honoured, the midshipman found himself in debt. jervis was forced to quit his mess and live on ship's rations in order to pay off the loan. the event deeply affected the young jervis who swore never to ""draw another bill without the certainty of it being paid"". ""sphinx"" was paid off at spithead on 7 november 1754. jervis was assigned to the 20-gun in december of the same year and then from the end of december until february 1755 was assigned to hm yacht ""william and mary"" under the navigational expert captain john campbell.  jervis passed his lieutenant's examination on 2 january 1755 and was assigned as sixth lieutenant to the first-rate of 100 guns. by march, he had moved to third lieutenant of the 60-gun . the ""nottingham"" was part of edward boscawen's fleet that attempted to prevent french reinforcements reaching new france. on 31 march 1756 jervis moved to the 74-gun hms and on 22 june he was promoted to be fourth lieutenant of the 90-gun ""prince"" under captain charles saunders in the mediterranean. when the captain was promoted to admiral, jervis followed him to the 74-gun in november 1756. in january 1757 jervis was promoted to temporary command of . in her, he fought a large french privateer in an indecisive action off cape gata. when the captain of the ""experiment"" regained his health jervis moved back to the ""culloden"". in june 1757, he followed saunders to the 90-gun hms ""st george"". jervis returned to england in temporary command of the 80-gun , a ship that had been captured by henry osborn's fleet at the battle of cartagena. he followed saunders once more when the admiral was promoted to command the north american station; jervis was promoted to lieutenant of hms ""prince"".  the fleet, part of an expedition to capture the french possessions in north america, left england in february 1759. they stopped first at louisbourg, which had been captured from the french the previous year. by june, the ice along the saint lawrence river had broken up and the fleet along with the military transports headed up river to the assault of quebec city. on 15 may 1759, jervis had been promoted acting commander of the sloop . in this command jervis impressed general james wolfe in the preparations that led to the battle of the plains of abraham. ""porcupine"" and the frigate led the armed transports past quebec to land up river. one biographer, jedediah tucker, notes that as the approach was so critical, both wolfe and the subsequently famous james cook boarded the ""porcupine"" to ensure the success of the mission.  for his efforts jervis was promoted commander and took command of . jervis returned to england in september but immediately returned to north america in command of the ""albany"". in may 1760 jervis was attached to admiral sir george rodney's channel squadron.  in october 1760 he was made post-captain in command of the 44-gun . ""gosport"" had on board a young midshipman, george elphinstone, later viscount keith, who took over jervis' command in the mediterranean after jervis' departure in 1799. in 1762, hms ""gosport"", and under captain joshua rowley, convoyed the east and west indian trade to the westward, and successfully protected it from the squadron of commodore de ternay.","he was tasked with delivering bullion to the english merchants in genoa. during his time in genoa two turkish slaves escaped a genoese galley and hid aboard one of ""alarm"" boats. they were forcibly removed; jervis made an official protest and promised retaliation if they were not handed over. the slaves were produced and jervis took custody of them.  on 30 march 1770 the ""alarm"" was driven ashore off marseilles but with the efforts of jervis, the crew and the local french authorities under the governor of marseilles, georges rené le peley de pléville she was brought off and repaired. jervis personally returned to marseilles with a letter of thanks from the board of the admiralty to the governor for his assistance.  in 1771 ""alarm"" returned to england to collect the duke of gloucester, king george iii's brother in order that he could winter in italy. he lived aboard with his entourage until may 1772 when ""alarm"" returned to england and was paid off.  between october 1772 and june 1775, jervis travelled extensively. he began in france where he studied the language and made observations about french life. he accompanied captain samuel barrington to russia where they spent time in saint petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at kronstadt and took a tour of the yacht designed by sir charles knowles for catherine of russia. the pair continued on to sweden, denmark and northern germany. all the while jervis made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. they came home via the netherlands, jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. he and barrington then took a private cruise along the channel coast calling at various harbours including brest, making and improving their charts as they went. when jervis later became the commander-in-chief of the channel fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of brest by these charts. in later years, he commented: ""had the young captain jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the earl st vincent would not have been able to effect such a thorough blockade of it.""  at the outbreak of the american war of independence in 1775 jervis was given the command of ; however, she was surveyed by the dockyard and found unfit for service. he was therefore appointed instead to command of hms ""foudroyant"", the ship he had brought to england as a prize seventeen years earlier. for the first few years of the war, the french supplied arms, funding, and military advice on an informal and limited basis to the newly emerging nation of america. with the signing of the treaty of alliance in 1778 and the creation of the franco-american alliance, the war widened. jervis spent the first few years of the war patrolling the channel in ""foudroyant"" without seeing any significant action, but as the war reached europe jervis was placed under the command of admiral augustus keppel. the channel fleet, under keppel, sighted the french fleet intending to enter brest on 23 july. the british fleet of 30 ships of the line chased the french fleet of 29 ships and engaged them on 27 july in what became known as the first battle of ushant. the battle was indecisive and in the political aftermath jervis provided a stalwart defence of admiral keppel at the latter's court-martial, helping to secure keppel's acquittal.  jervis remained in ""foudroyant"" attached to the channel fleet and for a short time acted as flag captain to admiral molyneux shuldham. in 1780 jervis was with admiral rodney when the british fleet relieved gibraltar. in 1781 he was with admiral george darby at the second relief of gibraltar. on 19 april 1782 jervis was with his old friend and travelling companion when a ship in admiral barrington's squadron sighted a french convoy leaving brest. the squadron gave chase and ""foudroyant"" caught and engaged the french 74-gun ""pégase"". after an engagement of more than an hour ""pégase"" struck. jervis himself was wounded in the attack. for his services he was invested as a knight of the bath on 19 may 1782. he was again at the relief of gibraltar with earl howe's fleet in 1782 and took part in the indecisive battle of cape spartel. jervis was promoted commodore and hoisted his broad pennant in the 50-gun in december 1782, with orders to proceed to the west indies. due to the peace negotiations his orders were rescinded and he struck his pennant on 14 january 1783.  during the peace jervis married his cousin martha, daughter of lord chief baron sir thomas parker. jervis was also returned as mp for launceston in 1783. jervis began his political career in earnest and voted for pitt's parliamentary reforms and against charles james fox and his east india bill. during the elections of 1784 jervis stood for election in the independent borough of great yarmouth where he was returned as mp alongside henry beaufoy. jervis then voted against pitt's further bills for reform but supported him once more during the 1788–1799 regency crisis.  on 24 september 1787 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the blue and hoisted his flag in the 74-gun ""carnatic"" for several months during the tensions arising from the prussian invasion of the netherlands. in 1790 jervis was recalled to service once more and moved his flag to the second-rate ""prince"" during the nootka sound crisis that threatened war between england and spain. also in 1790 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the white and stood down as mp for great yarmouth and stood instead for the chipping wycombe seat to which he was returned as mp alongside the earl wycombe. with his interest in politics wavering he spoke rarely and then almost exclusively on naval matters. in 1794 he resigned his seat and did not stand again for political office. in 1792 jervis proposed a scheme to alleviate the financial hardship of superannuated seamen. he later withdrew the proposal as viscount melville promised that the matter would be addressed by the admiralty board.  jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the blue and was appointed to command of the leeward islands station. jervis took with him an army that, combined with the navy, formed a joint military expedition. the goal of the expedition was to capture french colonies and thereby weaken france's international trade. the army commander was sir charles grey, a friend and political ally. jervis hoisted his flag in . he took grey's son, captain george grey, later sir george grey, 1st baronet, as his flag-captain. the combined forces captured the french colonies of martinique, guadeloupe and saint lucia and restored monarchist rule.  the french counter-attacked and recaptured guadeloupe on 2 june 1794. jervis and grey landed a force to recapture the island but were repulsed by the reinforced french garrison and the british expedition withdrew. in november 1794 admiral benjamin caldwell replaced jervis. disputes over prize money were widely held as the reason that jervis and grey were not awarded peerages for their service. grey and jervis' enemies proposed a vote of censure against the general and admiral. the vote itself was negative. the prize money for the capture of the three islands, when finally calculated, amounted to £70,000 that was due to the officers and men of the navy. if adjusted for inflation this would equal approximately £ as of 20. jervis and grey were however awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament for their services. on 12 april 1794 jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the white.  jervis was promoted admiral of the blue on 1 june 1795 and appointed to command the mediterranean fleet. unfortunately the ""boyne"" had caught fire on 1 may 1795 and had blown up in spithead, the result of an accident, and jervis lost almost all of his possessions. jervis went to take command of the mediterranean fleet in the frigate and once more took charles grey's son, captain george grey, as his flag-captain. jervis also took robert calder as his captain of the fleet. on arrival at gibraltar jervis took as his flagship. among jervis' subordinates were captains horatio nelson, cuthbert collingwood and thomas troubridge. jervis began a close blockade of toulon and nelson was assigned the task of aiding the austrian army along the italian coast. by september 1796 the british presence in the mediterranean had become untenable. napoleon had beaten britain's austrian allies who were in disarray and, in october, spain had surrendered and allied themselves to the french. jervis recalled admiral robert mann to aid in the blockade of cadiz. mann took his ships instead to spithead. jervis abandoned corsica between september and november 1796 and withdrew his forces to gibraltar. a spanish fleet made up of twenty four line-of-battle ships and seven frigates sailed from toulon on 1 february 1797. jervis' fleet of ten ships-of-the-line was patrolling off cape saint vincent and was subsequently joined by five more under sir william parker. the spanish admiral, josé de córdoba, had taken his ships into the atlantic to weather a storm and was making his way to cadiz when the two fleets caught sight of each other.  the british and spanish fleet sighted one another at dawn on 14 february 1797. the british fleet had fifteen line-of-battle ships against the twenty four spanish ships. on the quarter-deck of ""victory"", jervis and his flag captain, robert calder counted the ships. it was at this point jervis discovered that he was outnumbered nearly two-to-one: ""there are eight sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty five sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty seven sail of the line, sir john"" ""enough, sir, no more of that; the die is cast, and if there are fifty sail i will go through them."" a passenger aboard ""victory"", captain benjamin hallowell, achieved a brief notoriety for slapping the admiral on the back and calling out ""that's right sir john, that's right. by god, we shall give them a damned good licking!""  during the battle nelson, in command of , wore out of line and performed a stunning feat by capturing two of the enemy vessels within moments. nelson and his crew boarded and captured one and crossed her deck and boarded and captured the second, which had collided in the smoke and general melee of the battle. the move was later feted by the public and press and dubbed """"nelson's patent bridge for boarding first-rates""."" when the spanish retreated jervis did not press his advantage but consolidated his victory and began the lengthy job of repairing both his ships and crews. the british had suffered casualties of 73 killed and 227 wounded.  sir john did not mention nelson's achievement in his initial despatch to the admiralty despite nelson's obvious contribution to the success of the battle. in later despatches jervis did mention nelson. in one anecdote, when discussing the battle with his flag-captain, sir robert, who had been mentioned in the despatch and had been awarded a knighthood for his services, brought up the issue of nelson's disobedience of the admiral's orders for having worn out of the line of battle in order to engage the enemy. jervis silenced him by saying: ""it certainly was so, and if you ever commit such a breach of your orders, i will forgive you also.""  despite the capture of only four vessels, the battle of cape saint vincent became celebrated as an outstanding victory and the awards and recognition far outweighed the achievement. the bad news of the evacuation of the mediterranean, the capitulation of the spanish and the italian city-states and the defeat of the austrian army alongside the increasing threat of a french invasion of britain had depressed the politicians and general public. a victory, such as that of cape saint vincent, was more important for the morale of the country as a whole than its military ramifications. both jervis and nelson were hailed as heroes and jervis was made baron jervis of meaford and earl st vincent. songs were written about jervis and the battle and there was a general feeling of relief in both the government and people of britain. nelson for his services was invested as a knight of the bath. the now earl st vincent was gifted a pension for life of £3,000 per year. the city of london had already presented him with the freedom of the city in a gold box valued at 100 guineas for his success in the west indies and for this battle awarded him a presentation sword. the presentation box and sword are both currently held at the national maritime museum, greenwich. nelson was also awarded his freedom of the city of london for the battle of cape st vincent, and was to get a presentation sword for the nile. the sword awarded to jervis was the first of their kind that the city of london issued. st vincent was awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament and given a gold medal by the king. the ""london gazette"" published an advertisement in 1798 regarding the prize money that was due to the officers and men who had fought at the battle. the sum quoted was £140,000, in inflationary terms this would be approximately £ as of 20, of which, as admiral, jervis was entitled to a sizeable share. jervis resumed his blockade of the spanish fleet in cadiz.  during 1797 there was considerable discontent among the seamen of the royal navy. this discontent manifested itself at the nore and at spithead when the greater part of the channel fleet rose up against their officers. these mutinies were not overly violent and the officers were put ashore and the heads of the mutinies established their own order and kept the ships under ""committee"" control until their collective demands were met. the mutineers demands ranged from discontent at cruel officers to poor pay and long sea service without shore leave. there were other mutinies throughout the navy that year, most notably and both on the jamaica station. these mutinies resulted in the crews killing their officers and taking their ships into enemy held ports.  jervis had the reputation as a disciplinarian and put in place a new system that would ensure that the men in the mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. to begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. for example, jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.  jervis discouraged conversation in irish though he did not ban it. he ordered the marine detachments to be paraded every morning and, if there was a band available, for ""god save the king"" to be played. the marine detachment was then to remain armed at all times. marines and soldiers were also excused from duties in regard to the general running of the ship.  in order to keep his crews active and to ensure that the spanish did not perceive that there might be discontent in the fleet, jervis ordered the nightly bombardment of cadiz in his own words to ""divert the animal.""  the admiral isolated the ships from one another to minimise collusion and the opportunities the men might have to band together in mutiny. st vincent did ensure, however, that the men under his command were cared for. when the stock of tobacco ran low the admiral ensured that the supply was renewed from his own funds. when the postmaster in lisbon detained the letters and packets arriving from england for the men for fear that they would carry seditious communications, jervis set up a post office aboard his flagship to receive and distribute all the letters that arrived for both seamen, marines and officers.  jervis strictly adhered to the articles of war and individual regulations that he had written for his fleet. any infraction was dealt with harshly and he was renowned for treating both officers and seamen with the same harsh discipline. as an example, one officer who allowed his boats crew to plunder a fishing boat was placed before a court martial and it was ordered that he be ""degraded from the rank of midshipman in the most ignominious manner by having his uniform stripped from his back on the quarter deck of the (ship unknown)""[sic]"". before the whole ship's company and to be further disposed of as the commander-in-chief shall direct. to be mulcted of his pay now due to him for his services on board any ship of his majesty's service and to be rendered incapable of ever serving as an officer or a petty officer in any of his majesty's ships."" jervis later personally directed that the midshipman should have his head shaved, a notice hung around his neck describing his crime and that he should be solely responsible for the cleaning of the head (naval term for the communal toilets situated at the bow of the ship) until further notice. in another incident, st vincent instructed that two men aboard who were tried for mutiny on a saturday were executed on sunday. the men were duly executed but admiral charles thompson raised an objection to formal executions on the sabbath and jervis wrote to the board of admiralty demanding thompson's removal or that they accept his own resignation. the board relieved thompson. on 9 july 1797 nelson wrote to jervis congratulating him in his resolve and wholeheartedly supporting his decision to execute the men on a sunday.  jervis could also be exceptionally kind when he felt that the situation warranted it. on one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. the men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. one of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. in one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. the bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. the admiral saw the man and asked the problem. one of his officers told him and st vincent went to his cabin. when he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. ""roger odell you are convicted, sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the british oak with tears. what have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?"" the man told him what had happened and st vincent replied ""roger odell you are one of the best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life i never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the victory in the action with the spanish fleet. to show therefore that your commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. there is your money sir!"" the earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor ""but no more tears mind, no more tears sir"".  when nelson returned to the mediterranean st vincent wrote to earl spencer, first lord of the admiralty: ""i do assure your lordship that the arrival of admiral nelson has given me new life; you could not have gratified me more than in sending him. his presence in the mediterranean is so very essential."" st vincent detached nelson to pursue napoleon in his invasion of egypt rear-admiral sir john orde who was senior to nelson complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight. jervis ordered orde home. orde requested that he be court-martialled in order that he might have the opportunity to clear his name. the board refused. orde then requested that st vincent be brought before a court-martial. again, the board refused. the board censured jervis for not having supported his subordinates. orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. the challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered jervis to decline. before the challenge was formally declined, orde wrote to the board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.  when the men aboard the refused to execute a man for mutinous behaviour and their captain did nothing, the earl threatened the captain with replacement and had boats from the rest of the fleet armed with carronades surround the ""marlborough""; he then threatened to sink the ship if his orders were not carried out. the man was duly executed. st vincent turned to an officer beside him watching the mutineer hanging from the yard arm and said ""discipline is preserved, sir!""  between 1797 and 1799 alongside the suppression of mutiny jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of gibraltar including building a new victualling yard and water tanks to replenish his ships. after the battle of the nile the dockyards, under jervis' watchful eye, managed to successfully repair most of the fleet. lady lavinia bingham, wife of earl spencer wrote to st vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the nile. ""never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward than yours has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend."" nelson commented that he had ""never beheld a fleet equal to sir john jervis'"" having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water the admiral arranged for large tanks to be built in gibraltar. on 14 february 1799 st vincent was created admiral of the white. constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. despite his failing health, st vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the board reluctant to supersede him. by 17 june 1799 he had no choice but to resign his command and return to england. during his time ashore the earl lived in rochetts, essex with his wife.  as his health had improved he was given command of the channel fleet. st vincent was to comment ""the king and the government require it and the discipline of the british navy demands it. it is of no consequence to me whether i die afloat or ashore. the die is cast.""  he took command of the channel fleet in on 26 april 1800 and took up a close blockade of brest. once at brest he transferred to the ""ville de paris"" of 110 guns and took sir thomas troubridge as his captain of the fleet. he was also accompanied by his personal physician, doctor andrew baird. baird was later to become instrumental in the plans of the commander-in-chief and the health and well being of the channel fleet.  st vincent's appointment was not popular among the officers of the channel fleet. his reputation as a strict disciplinarian had followed him from the mediterranean and he immediately issued orders banning officers and captains from sleeping ashore and forbade them from travelling more than three miles from their ship. among other strict regulations introduced were orders that ships were to be repaired where possible at sea and that ushant was to be the official rendezvous for the channel fleet rather than the traditional torbay. the wife of one of his captains is said to have toasted the news of his appointment with the line ""may his next glass of wine choke the wretch."" ships were forbidden to go to spithead without specific written orders from the admiral or admiralty. during his command he remained with the fleet and became respected by the officers and men for suffering their hardships with them.  with the charts that he had made with barrington in 1775 the inshore squadron at brest was able to keep a much tighter blockade. in one incident, the inshore squadron sighted several french ships leaving brest. sir edward pellew, captain of hms ""impétueux"", gave chase. the rear admiral in charge of the inshore squadron recalled him, worried that the ""impétueux"" would run aground. the french escaped. after several letters went back and forth between the two admirals, st vincent, tired of his subordinate's excuses, took the entire offshore squadron and sailed them between the inshore squadron and the shore thus proving that the ships had a shallow enough draught to have given chase and captured the french. st vincent then wrote to the rear admiral and suggested that he strike his flag and return to shore for some needed rest.  st vincent was as generous in the channel as he had been in the mediterranean. a particular letter from england made the admiral host a dinner aboard the flagship for fifty of the officers whom he felt closest to. at the dinner he revealed that the letter was from an orphanage near paddington in london. the orphanage had run out of money to support the children of sailors who had died in the service of their country. st vincent solicited from each captain and lieutenant a sum of money and then added his own donation. the cutter sailed back to england the same evening. st vincent gave the orphanage £1,000  st vincent's skills as an administrator and logistician came into play and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. st vincent wrote to earl spencer, commenting ""i have ever considered the care of the sick and wounded as one of the first duties of a commander-in-chief, by sea or land."" based on doctor baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of fresh lemon juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. the effect was dramatic. the hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in november 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. in a letter to sir evan nepean, first secretary to the admiralty, st vincent described baird as ""the most valuable man in the navy not excepting the board itself,"" the oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at torre abbey overlooking torbay. vice-admiral sir henry harvey took over operational command of the fleet in st vincent's absence.  in 1801 in a letter to the board of admiralty, st vincent made the now famous remark: ""i do not say, my lords, that the french will not come. i say only they will not come by sea."" in 1801 st vincent was replaced by admiral william cornwallis and the new prime minister henry addington promoted st vincent to first lord of the admiralty.   in january 1801 st vincent had written a short letter to the then first lord earl spencer stating: ""nothing short of a radical sweep in the dockyards can cure the enormous evils and corruptions in them; and this cannot be attempted till we have peace."" as first lord st vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the navy, the royal dockyards and their civilian administration. consequently, he clashed with the various navy boards, the civil administration of the royal navy that administered among other things the navy yards and stores. st vincent saw these boards and individuals as hindering the efforts of the navy.  during the peace with france, after the treaty of amiens was signed on 25 march 1802, st vincent ordered the navy board to begin an investigation for fraud and corruption in the royal dockyards. he swiftly found that the investigations were not being conducted effectively and ordered the commissioners to retrieve all logs and accounts and inventories and put them under their ""personal seal"" in anticipation of the admiralty board travelling to the various yards itself and conducting their own inspection. the investigation began in earnest in 1802. st vincent swiftly uncovered casual and obvious abuses of the system. some men were listed as having done work, then over-time and then acted as night watchmen for years without a break of any kind. others were listed as workmen ashore but also as sailors receiving pay in the receiving ship. work was done and then the identical work was charged for over various periods, often by different departments or sections. in another yard, ""the men of an entire department were found to be incapables, as old, infirm boys, cripples, or idiots, and the department itself to have the appearance of an asylum for every rogue and vagabond that could not obtain a meal by any other means."" st vincent found that minor dockyard officials were the tip of a far bigger corruption. he lobbied the government to create a special commission of inquiry that would have the power to question suspects under oath. the cabinet determined that the outcome of such an inquiry might be damaging politically (and possibly in some cases, personally) and gave the board of inquiry permission to question suspects under oath but gave the suspects the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate themselves. this addendum removed the ability of the inquiry to act effectively in any way. the commission of inquiry produced twelve reports:   one of st vincent's biographers put the findings of the commission succinctly ""the valuable british oak rotted in the forests for want of the axe; the frames building rotted on the stocks for want of timber; the ships at sea rotted before their day because constructed of such worthless perishable materials.""   one reform st vincent did achieve was the introduction of block making machinery at the navy yard in portsmouth. the machinery was designed by marc isambard brunel and samuel bentham. by 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. the innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost of the project was recovered in three years. the revolution of machinery enabled the navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. this self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. the buildings that housed the block machinery remain to this day and make up part of the historic portsmouth dockyard.  as first lord, st vincent also determined to build a breakwater in plymouth. the first lord commissioned a civil engineer, john rennie, and joseph whidbey, the former master-attendant at woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.  st vincent spoke with the king regarding the contribution made by marines to the general service of the navy and recommended to the king that the prefix ""royal"" be added. these were the first official discussions into the retitling of the corps to royal marines.  during his tenure, the workers in the royal dockyards demanded an increase in pay due to an increase in living costs. st vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken an active role in the strike. he eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.  st vincent's gaze passed over every aspect of the navy from the sea fencibles to the navy hospitals. the earl attempted to disband the sea fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. doctor baird, st vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the sick and hurt board as inspector of all hospitals.  another burden of his promotion to first lord of the admiralty was that st vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers and their relatives and friends. soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. the more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. also, due to the peace with france the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. the first lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. despite st vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the admiralty.  the ways in which st vincent chose to communicate the rejections often depended on the number of letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. to the earl of portsmouth he wrote: ""i cannot possibly agree in opinion with your lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime."" a harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: ""although i cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of captain (name unknown) ""[sic.]"", there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which i lose no time in acknowledging;""  famously, when commander lord cochrane captured the 32-gun spanish frigate ""el gamo"" in the 14-gun sloop a promotion was the usual reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. it would be fair to argue that it would have been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. unfortunately for cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the french and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. a court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including cochrane's, it was only a formality. it was only when cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. unfortunately the commander thought that the first lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. these solicitations may have had a negative effect on cochrane's career as it is possible that jervis became irritated by them.  the detailed investigation into corruption that st vincent began caused him to become extremely unpopular as many influential men were involved in the various money making schemes perpetrated. the board of inquiry set up by st vincent was responsible for the impeachment of henry dundas, 1st viscount melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. st vincent had made an enemy of pitt and pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the first lord and the addington administration. st vincent left the office on 14 may 1804 when addington was replaced as prime minister by pitt. lord howick, second son of st vincent's friend sir charles grey came to his defence and with the assistance of charles james fox moved for a vote of thanks in the commons for st vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.  on 14 may 1806, john jeffery, one of the members of parliament for poole, opened a parliamentary debate condemning st vincent for ""unprecedented neglect in building and repairing of ships while his lordship presided at the board of admiralty and with delivering up the navy to his successor in a far less efficient state than that in which he received it"". this motion was rejected and instead the foreign secretary, charles james fox, proposed a vote of thanks to earl st vincent, ""that it appears to this house, that the conduct of the earl of st. vincent, in his late naval administration, has added an additional lustre to his exalted character, and is entitled to the approbation of this house.""  fox had said of st vincent's appointment in 1801 ""allow me to say, that i do not think it would be easy, if possible, to find a man in the whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person at the head of the admiralty – i mean the earl of st vincent."" and had continued his support of the earl throughout his time as first lord.  on 9 november 1805 st vincent was promoted admiral of the red. he took command of the channel fleet once more in the 110-gun first-rate . during his tenure in command he spent much of his time at a house that he rented in the village of rame. once again he issued the orders that had become so effective in the mediterranean and his previous channel command. once again these orders proved unpopular. for a short time in 1806 he gave command of the channel fleet to his second-in-command sir charles cotton in order that he might travel to portugal on a particular mission. portugal was under threat of invasion and st vincent had been ordered, if necessary, to take the portuguese court to its colony in brazil. the invasion of portugal was delayed and st vincent was recalled to the channel fleet. it was sir sidney smith and graham moore who led the royal family to safety in brazil. st vincent had long suffered from poor health and a change in government led to his resignation on 24 april 1807.  the earl had always attempted to promote on merit rather than patronage and had become increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. at his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the king. the king asked if the navy were a better institution now than it had been on st vincent's entrance into it. st vincent replied that it was not. he stated: ""sire i have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of members of parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on."" he continued on ""i would rather promote the son of an old deserving officer than of any noble in the land."" in a letter dated 18 october 1806 to viscount howick, then the first lord. ""if you will, my good lord, bring a bill into parliament to disqualify any officer under the rank of rear-admiral to sit in the house of commons, the navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than i possess to command your fleets."" presumably st vincent was referring to a particular member of parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.  in his retirement he seldom took his seat in the house of lords and made his last appearance in either 1810 or 1811. during these final years st vincent gave generously to various charities, organisations and individuals. he donated £500 to the wounded and survivors of the battle of waterloo and £300 to relieve starvation in ireland. st vincent also donated £100 to the building of a jewish chapel in whitechapel, london. in 1807 st vincent, as a member of the house of lords, opposed a bill to abolish the slave trade. his motives appear to have been practical rather than humanitarian or otherwise. st vincent argued that if britain were to ban the trade it would simply be continued by other countries and thereby britain would lose the revenue generated and be weakened accordingly. st vincent spoke in opposition to the convention of sintra he spoke against the walcheren campaign and then condemned its failure, although conspicuously excluded the failure of its officers and men. st vincent spoke in defence of lieutenant-general sir john moore's retreat through spain and portugal and condemned the government and army commanders for failure to support him thoroughly. in 1816 his wife martha died at rochetts in essex. the couple had no children. in the winter of 1818–1819 st vincent went to recover his health in france. when he arrived at toulon he was greeted by admiral édouard missiessy who said of st vincent that he was: ""as much the father of the french as of the english navy"".  in 1800 st vincent was made an honorary lieutenant-general of marines and in 1814 was promoted to general. these positions were little more than a sinecure and carried no official duties. in 1801 st vincent had been created viscount st vincent of meaford, staffordshire. a title that because he had no children passed to his nephew, edward jervis ricketts. in 1806 he was appointed as one of the thirty one elder brothers of trinity house. the elder brothers, along with the master, form the court of trinity house. in 1809 st vincent was honoured by john vi of portugal who awarded him the royal portuguese military order of the tower and sword in order to commemorate the safe arrival of the royal family in brazil, after napoleon had invaded portugal. in may 1814 he was promoted acting admiral of the fleet and commander-in-chief of the channel squadron. he was confirmed admiral of the fleet on 19 july 1821 and george iv sent him a gold topped baton as a symbol of the office. the baton is currently held in the collections of the national maritime museum, greenwich. on 2 january 1815 he was made knight grand cross of the order of the bath when the order was rearranged by the prince regent. the knight grand cross is the highest rank in the order.  st vincent died on 13 march 1823 and, because he had no children, the barony of jervis and the earldom of st vincent became extinct. his nephew, edward jervis ricketts, became the 2nd viscount st vincent and changed his surname to jervis, becoming edward jervis jervis in honour of his uncle. st vincent was buried at stone, staffordshire, in the family mausoleum, at his own request and a monument was erected in the crypt of st. paul's cathedral.  at least three ships and two stone frigates (or shore establishments) have been named either in honour of the earl or after that battle that he won. , commissioned in 1910, was the first of her class and therefore the class of battleship was named after her. the ""st. vincent""–class battleships included and . , a j-class destroyer, launched just prior to the second world war, was named after the admiral. hms ""jervis"" served throughout the war. she was known as a lucky ship as, despite taking part in several actions, she never lost a man to enemy fire. hms ""jervis bay"", an armed merchant cruiser that was lost in heroic circumstances, was indirectly named after him.  jervis has also been remembered in schools in england. he has a boarding house (saint vincent) named in his honour at the royal hospital school. st vincent college in gosport, england is named after the admiral's most famous battle.  as with many other officers during the great age of discovery there are several areas of the world named in the earl's honour. cape jervis and gulf st vincent, south australia, and jervis bay, new south wales, australia were named for him as was the town of vincentia and jervis bay national park. the county of st vincent, new south wales was also named in his honour. jervis inlet, in british columbia, canada, was also named for him.  though jervis clearly had a strong impact during the napoleonic wars and afterwards on the development of the navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of jervis are available, and those are seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. the most recent work related to jervis is ""the remaking of the english navy by admiral st. vincent: the great unclaimed naval revolution"" by charles arthur, 1986, but this focused more on jervis's reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. evelyn berkman's ""nelson's dear lord: portrait of st. vincent"" (1962), as the bibliographer eugene rasor points out, is merely an ""effort"" to create a biography. the same bibliographer says much the same about william milbourne james's """"old oak"": the life of john jervis, earl st. vincent"" (1950) and owen sherrard's ""a life of lord st. vincent"" (1933), pointing to both as mediocre. ruddock mackay published an article which documented the early life of jervis.","2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2","2,

84,French,"at the end of 1763 'gosport' has been paid and jervis remained unemployed until february 1769 when it has been appointed to 32-gun, the first coppered war in the royal navy.","admiral of the fleet john jervis, 1st earl of st vincent (9 january 1735 – 14 march 1823) was an admiral in the royal navy and member of parliament in the united kingdom. jervis served throughout the latter half of the 18th century and into the 19th, and was an active commander during the seven years' war, american war of independence, french revolutionary war and the napoleonic wars. he is best known for his victory at the 1797 battle of cape saint vincent, from which he earned his titles, and as a patron of horatio nelson.  jervis was also recognised by both political and military contemporaries as a fine administrator and naval reformer. as commander-in-chief of the mediterranean, between 1795 and 1799 he introduced a series of severe standing orders to avert mutiny. he applied those orders to both seamen and officers alike, a policy that made him a controversial figure. he took his disciplinarian system of command with him when he took command of the channel fleet in 1799. in 1801, as first lord of the admiralty he introduced a number of reforms that, though unpopular at the time, made the navy more efficient and more self-sufficient. he introduced innovations including block making machinery at portsmouth royal dockyard. st vincent was known for his generosity to officers he considered worthy of reward and his swift and often harsh punishment of those he felt deserved it.  jervis' entry in the ""oxford dictionary of national biography"" by p. k. crimmin describes his contribution to history: ""his importance lies in his being the organiser of victories; the creator of well-equipped, highly efficient fleets; and in training a school of officers as professional, energetic, and devoted to the service as himself.""  john jervis was born in meaford, staffordshire, on 9 january 1735, the second son of swynfen and elizabeth jervis. his father was a barrister, counsellor to the admiralty board and auditor of greenwich hospital.<ref name=""nc02/1"">""the naval chronicle"" vol. 4, pp. 2–3.</ref> swynfen jervis intended that his son should follow him to the bar. the young jervis was educated at burton-upon-trent grammar school and subsequently at reverend swinden's academy in greenwich, london.  their family name jervis is pronounced 'jarviss'. the name jervis originates from the norman name gervase.  at the age of thirteen jervis ran away and joined the navy at woolwich, london. after a short time he returned home as he had heard his family were very upset at his disappearance. lady jane hamilton (mother of sir william hamilton) and lady burlington became aware of jervis' desire to join the navy and lobbied his family on his behalf. eventually they introduced the jervis family to admiral george townshend who agreed to take the boy aboard one of his ships.  on 4 january 1749 jervis entered the navy as an able seaman aboard the 50-gun on her way to jamaica. on arrival in the west indies, jervis was detached on hm sloop to the mosquito coast where he saw constant service against spanish guarda-costas and privateers. when townshend quit the west indies he discharged jervis into the under admiral thomas cotes. cotes' flag captain henry dennis rated jervis as a midshipman. on 31 july 1754 jervis moved to the 24-gun . jervis commented in a letter to his sister: ""my chief employ when from my duty is reading studying navigation and perusing my old letters of which i have almost enough to make an octavo volume."" while in jamaica, the young jervis drew funds against his father's account with a local banker. when the reply came from england that the withdrawal could not be honoured, the midshipman found himself in debt. jervis was forced to quit his mess and live on ship's rations in order to pay off the loan. the event deeply affected the young jervis who swore never to ""draw another bill without the certainty of it being paid"". ""sphinx"" was paid off at spithead on 7 november 1754. jervis was assigned to the 20-gun in december of the same year and then from the end of december until february 1755 was assigned to hm yacht ""william and mary"" under the navigational expert captain john campbell.  jervis passed his lieutenant's examination on 2 january 1755 and was assigned as sixth lieutenant to the first-rate of 100 guns. by march, he had moved to third lieutenant of the 60-gun . the ""nottingham"" was part of edward boscawen's fleet that attempted to prevent french reinforcements reaching new france. on 31 march 1756 jervis moved to the 74-gun hms and on 22 june he was promoted to be fourth lieutenant of the 90-gun ""prince"" under captain charles saunders in the mediterranean. when the captain was promoted to admiral, jervis followed him to the 74-gun in november 1756. in january 1757 jervis was promoted to temporary command of . in her, he fought a large french privateer in an indecisive action off cape gata. when the captain of the ""experiment"" regained his health jervis moved back to the ""culloden"". in june 1757, he followed saunders to the 90-gun hms ""st george"". jervis returned to england in temporary command of the 80-gun , a ship that had been captured by henry osborn's fleet at the battle of cartagena. he followed saunders once more when the admiral was promoted to command the north american station; jervis was promoted to lieutenant of hms ""prince"".  the fleet, part of an expedition to capture the french possessions in north america, left england in february 1759. they stopped first at louisbourg, which had been captured from the french the previous year. by june, the ice along the saint lawrence river had broken up and the fleet along with the military transports headed up river to the assault of quebec city. on 15 may 1759, jervis had been promoted acting commander of the sloop . in this command jervis impressed general james wolfe in the preparations that led to the battle of the plains of abraham. ""porcupine"" and the frigate led the armed transports past quebec to land up river. one biographer, jedediah tucker, notes that as the approach was so critical, both wolfe and the subsequently famous james cook boarded the ""porcupine"" to ensure the success of the mission.  for his efforts jervis was promoted commander and took command of . jervis returned to england in september but immediately returned to north america in command of the ""albany"". in may 1760 jervis was attached to admiral sir george rodney's channel squadron.  in october 1760 he was made post-captain in command of the 44-gun . ""gosport"" had on board a young midshipman, george elphinstone, later viscount keith, who took over jervis' command in the mediterranean after jervis' departure in 1799. in 1762, hms ""gosport"", and under captain joshua rowley, convoyed the east and west indian trade to the westward, and successfully protected it from the squadron of commodore de ternay.","he was tasked with delivering bullion to the english merchants in genoa. during his time in genoa two turkish slaves escaped a genoese galley and hid aboard one of ""alarm"" boats. they were forcibly removed; jervis made an official protest and promised retaliation if they were not handed over. the slaves were produced and jervis took custody of them.  on 30 march 1770 the ""alarm"" was driven ashore off marseilles but with the efforts of jervis, the crew and the local french authorities under the governor of marseilles, georges rené le peley de pléville she was brought off and repaired. jervis personally returned to marseilles with a letter of thanks from the board of the admiralty to the governor for his assistance.  in 1771 ""alarm"" returned to england to collect the duke of gloucester, king george iii's brother in order that he could winter in italy. he lived aboard with his entourage until may 1772 when ""alarm"" returned to england and was paid off.  between october 1772 and june 1775, jervis travelled extensively. he began in france where he studied the language and made observations about french life. he accompanied captain samuel barrington to russia where they spent time in saint petersburg and inspected the arsenal and dockyards at kronstadt and took a tour of the yacht designed by sir charles knowles for catherine of russia. the pair continued on to sweden, denmark and northern germany. all the while jervis made notes on defences, harbour charts and safe anchorages. they came home via the netherlands, jervis once again making extensive studies of the area and taking copious notes describing any useful information. he and barrington then took a private cruise along the channel coast calling at various harbours including brest, making and improving their charts as they went. when jervis later became the commander-in-chief of the channel fleet he was aided significantly in his blockade of brest by these charts. in later years, he commented: ""had the young captain jervis not performed such a complete survey of this port then the earl st vincent would not have been able to effect such a thorough blockade of it.""  at the outbreak of the american war of independence in 1775 jervis was given the command of ; however, she was surveyed by the dockyard and found unfit for service. he was therefore appointed instead to command of hms ""foudroyant"", the ship he had brought to england as a prize seventeen years earlier. for the first few years of the war, the french supplied arms, funding, and military advice on an informal and limited basis to the newly emerging nation of america. with the signing of the treaty of alliance in 1778 and the creation of the franco-american alliance, the war widened. jervis spent the first few years of the war patrolling the channel in ""foudroyant"" without seeing any significant action, but as the war reached europe jervis was placed under the command of admiral augustus keppel. the channel fleet, under keppel, sighted the french fleet intending to enter brest on 23 july. the british fleet of 30 ships of the line chased the french fleet of 29 ships and engaged them on 27 july in what became known as the first battle of ushant. the battle was indecisive and in the political aftermath jervis provided a stalwart defence of admiral keppel at the latter's court-martial, helping to secure keppel's acquittal.  jervis remained in ""foudroyant"" attached to the channel fleet and for a short time acted as flag captain to admiral molyneux shuldham. in 1780 jervis was with admiral rodney when the british fleet relieved gibraltar. in 1781 he was with admiral george darby at the second relief of gibraltar. on 19 april 1782 jervis was with his old friend and travelling companion when a ship in admiral barrington's squadron sighted a french convoy leaving brest. the squadron gave chase and ""foudroyant"" caught and engaged the french 74-gun ""pégase"". after an engagement of more than an hour ""pégase"" struck. jervis himself was wounded in the attack. for his services he was invested as a knight of the bath on 19 may 1782. he was again at the relief of gibraltar with earl howe's fleet in 1782 and took part in the indecisive battle of cape spartel. jervis was promoted commodore and hoisted his broad pennant in the 50-gun in december 1782, with orders to proceed to the west indies. due to the peace negotiations his orders were rescinded and he struck his pennant on 14 january 1783.  during the peace jervis married his cousin martha, daughter of lord chief baron sir thomas parker. jervis was also returned as mp for launceston in 1783. jervis began his political career in earnest and voted for pitt's parliamentary reforms and against charles james fox and his east india bill. during the elections of 1784 jervis stood for election in the independent borough of great yarmouth where he was returned as mp alongside henry beaufoy. jervis then voted against pitt's further bills for reform but supported him once more during the 1788–1799 regency crisis.  on 24 september 1787 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the blue and hoisted his flag in the 74-gun ""carnatic"" for several months during the tensions arising from the prussian invasion of the netherlands. in 1790 jervis was recalled to service once more and moved his flag to the second-rate ""prince"" during the nootka sound crisis that threatened war between england and spain. also in 1790 jervis was promoted rear-admiral of the white and stood down as mp for great yarmouth and stood instead for the chipping wycombe seat to which he was returned as mp alongside the earl wycombe. with his interest in politics wavering he spoke rarely and then almost exclusively on naval matters. in 1794 he resigned his seat and did not stand again for political office. in 1792 jervis proposed a scheme to alleviate the financial hardship of superannuated seamen. he later withdrew the proposal as viscount melville promised that the matter would be addressed by the admiralty board.  jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the blue and was appointed to command of the leeward islands station. jervis took with him an army that, combined with the navy, formed a joint military expedition. the goal of the expedition was to capture french colonies and thereby weaken france's international trade. the army commander was sir charles grey, a friend and political ally. jervis hoisted his flag in . he took grey's son, captain george grey, later sir george grey, 1st baronet, as his flag-captain. the combined forces captured the french colonies of martinique, guadeloupe and saint lucia and restored monarchist rule.  the french counter-attacked and recaptured guadeloupe on 2 june 1794. jervis and grey landed a force to recapture the island but were repulsed by the reinforced french garrison and the british expedition withdrew. in november 1794 admiral benjamin caldwell replaced jervis. disputes over prize money were widely held as the reason that jervis and grey were not awarded peerages for their service. grey and jervis' enemies proposed a vote of censure against the general and admiral. the vote itself was negative. the prize money for the capture of the three islands, when finally calculated, amounted to £70,000 that was due to the officers and men of the navy. if adjusted for inflation this would equal approximately £ as of 20. jervis and grey were however awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament for their services. on 12 april 1794 jervis was promoted vice-admiral of the white.  jervis was promoted admiral of the blue on 1 june 1795 and appointed to command the mediterranean fleet. unfortunately the ""boyne"" had caught fire on 1 may 1795 and had blown up in spithead, the result of an accident, and jervis lost almost all of his possessions. jervis went to take command of the mediterranean fleet in the frigate and once more took charles grey's son, captain george grey, as his flag-captain. jervis also took robert calder as his captain of the fleet. on arrival at gibraltar jervis took as his flagship. among jervis' subordinates were captains horatio nelson, cuthbert collingwood and thomas troubridge. jervis began a close blockade of toulon and nelson was assigned the task of aiding the austrian army along the italian coast. by september 1796 the british presence in the mediterranean had become untenable. napoleon had beaten britain's austrian allies who were in disarray and, in october, spain had surrendered and allied themselves to the french. jervis recalled admiral robert mann to aid in the blockade of cadiz. mann took his ships instead to spithead. jervis abandoned corsica between september and november 1796 and withdrew his forces to gibraltar. a spanish fleet made up of twenty four line-of-battle ships and seven frigates sailed from toulon on 1 february 1797. jervis' fleet of ten ships-of-the-line was patrolling off cape saint vincent and was subsequently joined by five more under sir william parker. the spanish admiral, josé de córdoba, had taken his ships into the atlantic to weather a storm and was making his way to cadiz when the two fleets caught sight of each other.  the british and spanish fleet sighted one another at dawn on 14 february 1797. the british fleet had fifteen line-of-battle ships against the twenty four spanish ships. on the quarter-deck of ""victory"", jervis and his flag captain, robert calder counted the ships. it was at this point jervis discovered that he was outnumbered nearly two-to-one: ""there are eight sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty five sail of the line, sir john"" ""very well, sir"" ""there are twenty seven sail of the line, sir john"" ""enough, sir, no more of that; the die is cast, and if there are fifty sail i will go through them."" a passenger aboard ""victory"", captain benjamin hallowell, achieved a brief notoriety for slapping the admiral on the back and calling out ""that's right sir john, that's right. by god, we shall give them a damned good licking!""  during the battle nelson, in command of , wore out of line and performed a stunning feat by capturing two of the enemy vessels within moments. nelson and his crew boarded and captured one and crossed her deck and boarded and captured the second, which had collided in the smoke and general melee of the battle. the move was later feted by the public and press and dubbed """"nelson's patent bridge for boarding first-rates""."" when the spanish retreated jervis did not press his advantage but consolidated his victory and began the lengthy job of repairing both his ships and crews. the british had suffered casualties of 73 killed and 227 wounded.  sir john did not mention nelson's achievement in his initial despatch to the admiralty despite nelson's obvious contribution to the success of the battle. in later despatches jervis did mention nelson. in one anecdote, when discussing the battle with his flag-captain, sir robert, who had been mentioned in the despatch and had been awarded a knighthood for his services, brought up the issue of nelson's disobedience of the admiral's orders for having worn out of the line of battle in order to engage the enemy. jervis silenced him by saying: ""it certainly was so, and if you ever commit such a breach of your orders, i will forgive you also.""  despite the capture of only four vessels, the battle of cape saint vincent became celebrated as an outstanding victory and the awards and recognition far outweighed the achievement. the bad news of the evacuation of the mediterranean, the capitulation of the spanish and the italian city-states and the defeat of the austrian army alongside the increasing threat of a french invasion of britain had depressed the politicians and general public. a victory, such as that of cape saint vincent, was more important for the morale of the country as a whole than its military ramifications. both jervis and nelson were hailed as heroes and jervis was made baron jervis of meaford and earl st vincent. songs were written about jervis and the battle and there was a general feeling of relief in both the government and people of britain. nelson for his services was invested as a knight of the bath. the now earl st vincent was gifted a pension for life of £3,000 per year. the city of london had already presented him with the freedom of the city in a gold box valued at 100 guineas for his success in the west indies and for this battle awarded him a presentation sword. the presentation box and sword are both currently held at the national maritime museum, greenwich. nelson was also awarded his freedom of the city of london for the battle of cape st vincent, and was to get a presentation sword for the nile. the sword awarded to jervis was the first of their kind that the city of london issued. st vincent was awarded the thanks of both houses of parliament and given a gold medal by the king. the ""london gazette"" published an advertisement in 1798 regarding the prize money that was due to the officers and men who had fought at the battle. the sum quoted was £140,000, in inflationary terms this would be approximately £ as of 20, of which, as admiral, jervis was entitled to a sizeable share. jervis resumed his blockade of the spanish fleet in cadiz.  during 1797 there was considerable discontent among the seamen of the royal navy. this discontent manifested itself at the nore and at spithead when the greater part of the channel fleet rose up against their officers. these mutinies were not overly violent and the officers were put ashore and the heads of the mutinies established their own order and kept the ships under ""committee"" control until their collective demands were met. the mutineers demands ranged from discontent at cruel officers to poor pay and long sea service without shore leave. there were other mutinies throughout the navy that year, most notably and both on the jamaica station. these mutinies resulted in the crews killing their officers and taking their ships into enemy held ports.  jervis had the reputation as a disciplinarian and put in place a new system that would ensure that the men in the mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. to begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. for example, jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.  jervis discouraged conversation in irish though he did not ban it. he ordered the marine detachments to be paraded every morning and, if there was a band available, for ""god save the king"" to be played. the marine detachment was then to remain armed at all times. marines and soldiers were also excused from duties in regard to the general running of the ship.  in order to keep his crews active and to ensure that the spanish did not perceive that there might be discontent in the fleet, jervis ordered the nightly bombardment of cadiz in his own words to ""divert the animal.""  the admiral isolated the ships from one another to minimise collusion and the opportunities the men might have to band together in mutiny. st vincent did ensure, however, that the men under his command were cared for. when the stock of tobacco ran low the admiral ensured that the supply was renewed from his own funds. when the postmaster in lisbon detained the letters and packets arriving from england for the men for fear that they would carry seditious communications, jervis set up a post office aboard his flagship to receive and distribute all the letters that arrived for both seamen, marines and officers.  jervis strictly adhered to the articles of war and individual regulations that he had written for his fleet. any infraction was dealt with harshly and he was renowned for treating both officers and seamen with the same harsh discipline. as an example, one officer who allowed his boats crew to plunder a fishing boat was placed before a court martial and it was ordered that he be ""degraded from the rank of midshipman in the most ignominious manner by having his uniform stripped from his back on the quarter deck of the (ship unknown)""[sic]"". before the whole ship's company and to be further disposed of as the commander-in-chief shall direct. to be mulcted of his pay now due to him for his services on board any ship of his majesty's service and to be rendered incapable of ever serving as an officer or a petty officer in any of his majesty's ships."" jervis later personally directed that the midshipman should have his head shaved, a notice hung around his neck describing his crime and that he should be solely responsible for the cleaning of the head (naval term for the communal toilets situated at the bow of the ship) until further notice. in another incident, st vincent instructed that two men aboard who were tried for mutiny on a saturday were executed on sunday. the men were duly executed but admiral charles thompson raised an objection to formal executions on the sabbath and jervis wrote to the board of admiralty demanding thompson's removal or that they accept his own resignation. the board relieved thompson. on 9 july 1797 nelson wrote to jervis congratulating him in his resolve and wholeheartedly supporting his decision to execute the men on a sunday.  jervis could also be exceptionally kind when he felt that the situation warranted it. on one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. the men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. one of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. in one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. the bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. the admiral saw the man and asked the problem. one of his officers told him and st vincent went to his cabin. when he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. ""roger odell you are convicted, sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the british oak with tears. what have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?"" the man told him what had happened and st vincent replied ""roger odell you are one of the best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life i never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the victory in the action with the spanish fleet. to show therefore that your commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. there is your money sir!"" the earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor ""but no more tears mind, no more tears sir"".  when nelson returned to the mediterranean st vincent wrote to earl spencer, first lord of the admiralty: ""i do assure your lordship that the arrival of admiral nelson has given me new life; you could not have gratified me more than in sending him. his presence in the mediterranean is so very essential."" st vincent detached nelson to pursue napoleon in his invasion of egypt rear-admiral sir john orde who was senior to nelson complained publicly and bitterly about what he considered a personal slight. jervis ordered orde home. orde requested that he be court-martialled in order that he might have the opportunity to clear his name. the board refused. orde then requested that st vincent be brought before a court-martial. again, the board refused. the board censured jervis for not having supported his subordinates. orde later challenged the ageing admiral to a duel. the challenge became public knowledge and the king ordered jervis to decline. before the challenge was formally declined, orde wrote to the board to inform them that he had withdrawn it.  when the men aboard the refused to execute a man for mutinous behaviour and their captain did nothing, the earl threatened the captain with replacement and had boats from the rest of the fleet armed with carronades surround the ""marlborough""; he then threatened to sink the ship if his orders were not carried out. the man was duly executed. st vincent turned to an officer beside him watching the mutineer hanging from the yard arm and said ""discipline is preserved, sir!""  between 1797 and 1799 alongside the suppression of mutiny jervis set himself the task of improving the dockyards and defences of gibraltar including building a new victualling yard and water tanks to replenish his ships. after the battle of the nile the dockyards, under jervis' watchful eye, managed to successfully repair most of the fleet. lady lavinia bingham, wife of earl spencer wrote to st vincent to congratulate him for having provided the necessary tools for nelson to have achieved the victory he did at the nile. ""never did disinterested zeal and friendship meet with a brighter reward than yours has reaped in this victory of your gallant friend."" nelson commented that he had ""never beheld a fleet equal to sir john jervis'"" having had great difficulty supplying the fleet with fresh water the admiral arranged for large tanks to be built in gibraltar. on 14 february 1799 st vincent was created admiral of the white. constant service and approaching old age meant that the admiral became increasingly unwell. despite his failing health, st vincent was reluctant to relinquish command and the board reluctant to supersede him. by 17 june 1799 he had no choice but to resign his command and return to england. during his time ashore the earl lived in rochetts, essex with his wife.  as his health had improved he was given command of the channel fleet. st vincent was to comment ""the king and the government require it and the discipline of the british navy demands it. it is of no consequence to me whether i die afloat or ashore. the die is cast.""  he took command of the channel fleet in on 26 april 1800 and took up a close blockade of brest. once at brest he transferred to the ""ville de paris"" of 110 guns and took sir thomas troubridge as his captain of the fleet. he was also accompanied by his personal physician, doctor andrew baird. baird was later to become instrumental in the plans of the commander-in-chief and the health and well being of the channel fleet.  st vincent's appointment was not popular among the officers of the channel fleet. his reputation as a strict disciplinarian had followed him from the mediterranean and he immediately issued orders banning officers and captains from sleeping ashore and forbade them from travelling more than three miles from their ship. among other strict regulations introduced were orders that ships were to be repaired where possible at sea and that ushant was to be the official rendezvous for the channel fleet rather than the traditional torbay. the wife of one of his captains is said to have toasted the news of his appointment with the line ""may his next glass of wine choke the wretch."" ships were forbidden to go to spithead without specific written orders from the admiral or admiralty. during his command he remained with the fleet and became respected by the officers and men for suffering their hardships with them.  with the charts that he had made with barrington in 1775 the inshore squadron at brest was able to keep a much tighter blockade. in one incident, the inshore squadron sighted several french ships leaving brest. sir edward pellew, captain of hms ""impétueux"", gave chase. the rear admiral in charge of the inshore squadron recalled him, worried that the ""impétueux"" would run aground. the french escaped. after several letters went back and forth between the two admirals, st vincent, tired of his subordinate's excuses, took the entire offshore squadron and sailed them between the inshore squadron and the shore thus proving that the ships had a shallow enough draught to have given chase and captured the french. st vincent then wrote to the rear admiral and suggested that he strike his flag and return to shore for some needed rest.  st vincent was as generous in the channel as he had been in the mediterranean. a particular letter from england made the admiral host a dinner aboard the flagship for fifty of the officers whom he felt closest to. at the dinner he revealed that the letter was from an orphanage near paddington in london. the orphanage had run out of money to support the children of sailors who had died in the service of their country. st vincent solicited from each captain and lieutenant a sum of money and then added his own donation. the cutter sailed back to england the same evening. st vincent gave the orphanage £1,000  st vincent's skills as an administrator and logistician came into play and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. st vincent wrote to earl spencer, commenting ""i have ever considered the care of the sick and wounded as one of the first duties of a commander-in-chief, by sea or land."" based on doctor baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of fresh lemon juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. the effect was dramatic. the hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in november 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. in a letter to sir evan nepean, first secretary to the admiralty, st vincent described baird as ""the most valuable man in the navy not excepting the board itself,"" the oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at torre abbey overlooking torbay. vice-admiral sir henry harvey took over operational command of the fleet in st vincent's absence.  in 1801 in a letter to the board of admiralty, st vincent made the now famous remark: ""i do not say, my lords, that the french will not come. i say only they will not come by sea."" in 1801 st vincent was replaced by admiral william cornwallis and the new prime minister henry addington promoted st vincent to first lord of the admiralty.   in january 1801 st vincent had written a short letter to the then first lord earl spencer stating: ""nothing short of a radical sweep in the dockyards can cure the enormous evils and corruptions in them; and this cannot be attempted till we have peace."" as first lord st vincent intended to investigate, discover and remove all of the corruption that he considered plagued the navy, the royal dockyards and their civilian administration. consequently, he clashed with the various navy boards, the civil administration of the royal navy that administered among other things the navy yards and stores. st vincent saw these boards and individuals as hindering the efforts of the navy.  during the peace with france, after the treaty of amiens was signed on 25 march 1802, st vincent ordered the navy board to begin an investigation for fraud and corruption in the royal dockyards. he swiftly found that the investigations were not being conducted effectively and ordered the commissioners to retrieve all logs and accounts and inventories and put them under their ""personal seal"" in anticipation of the admiralty board travelling to the various yards itself and conducting their own inspection. the investigation began in earnest in 1802. st vincent swiftly uncovered casual and obvious abuses of the system. some men were listed as having done work, then over-time and then acted as night watchmen for years without a break of any kind. others were listed as workmen ashore but also as sailors receiving pay in the receiving ship. work was done and then the identical work was charged for over various periods, often by different departments or sections. in another yard, ""the men of an entire department were found to be incapables, as old, infirm boys, cripples, or idiots, and the department itself to have the appearance of an asylum for every rogue and vagabond that could not obtain a meal by any other means."" st vincent found that minor dockyard officials were the tip of a far bigger corruption. he lobbied the government to create a special commission of inquiry that would have the power to question suspects under oath. the cabinet determined that the outcome of such an inquiry might be damaging politically (and possibly in some cases, personally) and gave the board of inquiry permission to question suspects under oath but gave the suspects the right to refuse to answer questions that might incriminate themselves. this addendum removed the ability of the inquiry to act effectively in any way. the commission of inquiry produced twelve reports:   one of st vincent's biographers put the findings of the commission succinctly ""the valuable british oak rotted in the forests for want of the axe; the frames building rotted on the stocks for want of timber; the ships at sea rotted before their day because constructed of such worthless perishable materials.""   one reform st vincent did achieve was the introduction of block making machinery at the navy yard in portsmouth. the machinery was designed by marc isambard brunel and samuel bentham. by 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. the innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost of the project was recovered in three years. the revolution of machinery enabled the navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. this self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. the buildings that housed the block machinery remain to this day and make up part of the historic portsmouth dockyard.  as first lord, st vincent also determined to build a breakwater in plymouth. the first lord commissioned a civil engineer, john rennie, and joseph whidbey, the former master-attendant at woolwich dockyard, to design the breakwater. work did not begin until 1811 but the earl is widely credited as the force behind its construction.  st vincent spoke with the king regarding the contribution made by marines to the general service of the navy and recommended to the king that the prefix ""royal"" be added. these were the first official discussions into the retitling of the corps to royal marines.  during his tenure, the workers in the royal dockyards demanded an increase in pay due to an increase in living costs. st vincent reacted by dismissing the ringleaders and every man who had taken an active role in the strike. he eventually agreed to a small temporary allowance for the purchase of bread while the price of bread remained high.  st vincent's gaze passed over every aspect of the navy from the sea fencibles to the navy hospitals. the earl attempted to disband the sea fencibles claiming that they were needed only to quiet the fears of little old ladies and that good men passed their whole careers without hearing a shot fired. doctor baird, st vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the sick and hurt board as inspector of all hospitals.  another burden of his promotion to first lord of the admiralty was that st vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers and their relatives and friends. soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. the more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. also, due to the peace with france the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. the first lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. despite st vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the admiralty.  the ways in which st vincent chose to communicate the rejections often depended on the number of letters, the individual concerned, or the demands made by their respective well wishers. to the earl of portsmouth he wrote: ""i cannot possibly agree in opinion with your lordship, that a person sitting quietly by his fireside, and enjoying very nearly a sinecure, during such a war as we have been engaged in, has the same pretensions to promotion with the man who has exposed his person, and hazarded his constitution in every clime."" a harsh rebuff to a peer of the realm. yet to a lady of no discernible rank or influence he wrote: ""although i cannot admit the force of your argument in favour of captain (name unknown) ""[sic.]"", there is something so amiable and laudable in a sister contending for the promotion of her brother that no apology was necessary for your letter of the 24th, which i lose no time in acknowledging;""  famously, when commander lord cochrane captured the 32-gun spanish frigate ""el gamo"" in the 14-gun sloop a promotion was the usual reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. it would be fair to argue that it would have been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. unfortunately for cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the french and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. a court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including cochrane's, it was only a formality. it was only when cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. unfortunately the commander thought that the first lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. these solicitations may have had a negative effect on cochrane's career as it is possible that jervis became irritated by them.  the detailed investigation into corruption that st vincent began caused him to become extremely unpopular as many influential men were involved in the various money making schemes perpetrated. the board of inquiry set up by st vincent was responsible for the impeachment of henry dundas, 1st viscount melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. st vincent had made an enemy of pitt and pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the first lord and the addington administration. st vincent left the office on 14 may 1804 when addington was replaced as prime minister by pitt. lord howick, second son of st vincent's friend sir charles grey came to his defence and with the assistance of charles james fox moved for a vote of thanks in the commons for st vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.  on 14 may 1806, john jeffery, one of the members of parliament for poole, opened a parliamentary debate condemning st vincent for ""unprecedented neglect in building and repairing of ships while his lordship presided at the board of admiralty and with delivering up the navy to his successor in a far less efficient state than that in which he received it"". this motion was rejected and instead the foreign secretary, charles james fox, proposed a vote of thanks to earl st vincent, ""that it appears to this house, that the conduct of the earl of st. vincent, in his late naval administration, has added an additional lustre to his exalted character, and is entitled to the approbation of this house.""  fox had said of st vincent's appointment in 1801 ""allow me to say, that i do not think it would be easy, if possible, to find a man in the whole community better suited, or more capable of the high office he fills, than the distinguished person at the head of the admiralty – i mean the earl of st vincent."" and had continued his support of the earl throughout his time as first lord.  on 9 november 1805 st vincent was promoted admiral of the red. he took command of the channel fleet once more in the 110-gun first-rate . during his tenure in command he spent much of his time at a house that he rented in the village of rame. once again he issued the orders that had become so effective in the mediterranean and his previous channel command. once again these orders proved unpopular. for a short time in 1806 he gave command of the channel fleet to his second-in-command sir charles cotton in order that he might travel to portugal on a particular mission. portugal was under threat of invasion and st vincent had been ordered, if necessary, to take the portuguese court to its colony in brazil. the invasion of portugal was delayed and st vincent was recalled to the channel fleet. it was sir sidney smith and graham moore who led the royal family to safety in brazil. st vincent had long suffered from poor health and a change in government led to his resignation on 24 april 1807.  the earl had always attempted to promote on merit rather than patronage and had become increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. at his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the king. the king asked if the navy were a better institution now than it had been on st vincent's entrance into it. st vincent replied that it was not. he stated: ""sire i have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of members of parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on."" he continued on ""i would rather promote the son of an old deserving officer than of any noble in the land."" in a letter dated 18 october 1806 to viscount howick, then the first lord. ""if you will, my good lord, bring a bill into parliament to disqualify any officer under the rank of rear-admiral to sit in the house of commons, the navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than i possess to command your fleets."" presumably st vincent was referring to a particular member of parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.  in his retirement he seldom took his seat in the house of lords and made his last appearance in either 1810 or 1811. during these final years st vincent gave generously to various charities, organisations and individuals. he donated £500 to the wounded and survivors of the battle of waterloo and £300 to relieve starvation in ireland. st vincent also donated £100 to the building of a jewish chapel in whitechapel, london. in 1807 st vincent, as a member of the house of lords, opposed a bill to abolish the slave trade. his motives appear to have been practical rather than humanitarian or otherwise. st vincent argued that if britain were to ban the trade it would simply be continued by other countries and thereby britain would lose the revenue generated and be weakened accordingly. st vincent spoke in opposition to the convention of sintra he spoke against the walcheren campaign and then condemned its failure, although conspicuously excluded the failure of its officers and men. st vincent spoke in defence of lieutenant-general sir john moore's retreat through spain and portugal and condemned the government and army commanders for failure to support him thoroughly. in 1816 his wife martha died at rochetts in essex. the couple had no children. in the winter of 1818–1819 st vincent went to recover his health in france. when he arrived at toulon he was greeted by admiral édouard missiessy who said of st vincent that he was: ""as much the father of the french as of the english navy"".  in 1800 st vincent was made an honorary lieutenant-general of marines and in 1814 was promoted to general. these positions were little more than a sinecure and carried no official duties. in 1801 st vincent had been created viscount st vincent of meaford, staffordshire. a title that because he had no children passed to his nephew, edward jervis ricketts. in 1806 he was appointed as one of the thirty one elder brothers of trinity house. the elder brothers, along with the master, form the court of trinity house. in 1809 st vincent was honoured by john vi of portugal who awarded him the royal portuguese military order of the tower and sword in order to commemorate the safe arrival of the royal family in brazil, after napoleon had invaded portugal. in may 1814 he was promoted acting admiral of the fleet and commander-in-chief of the channel squadron. he was confirmed admiral of the fleet on 19 july 1821 and george iv sent him a gold topped baton as a symbol of the office. the baton is currently held in the collections of the national maritime museum, greenwich. on 2 january 1815 he was made knight grand cross of the order of the bath when the order was rearranged by the prince regent. the knight grand cross is the highest rank in the order.  st vincent died on 13 march 1823 and, because he had no children, the barony of jervis and the earldom of st vincent became extinct. his nephew, edward jervis ricketts, became the 2nd viscount st vincent and changed his surname to jervis, becoming edward jervis jervis in honour of his uncle. st vincent was buried at stone, staffordshire, in the family mausoleum, at his own request and a monument was erected in the crypt of st. paul's cathedral.  at least three ships and two stone frigates (or shore establishments) have been named either in honour of the earl or after that battle that he won. , commissioned in 1910, was the first of her class and therefore the class of battleship was named after her. the ""st. vincent""–class battleships included and . , a j-class destroyer, launched just prior to the second world war, was named after the admiral. hms ""jervis"" served throughout the war. she was known as a lucky ship as, despite taking part in several actions, she never lost a man to enemy fire. hms ""jervis bay"", an armed merchant cruiser that was lost in heroic circumstances, was indirectly named after him.  jervis has also been remembered in schools in england. he has a boarding house (saint vincent) named in his honour at the royal hospital school. st vincent college in gosport, england is named after the admiral's most famous battle.  as with many other officers during the great age of discovery there are several areas of the world named in the earl's honour. cape jervis and gulf st vincent, south australia, and jervis bay, new south wales, australia were named for him as was the town of vincentia and jervis bay national park. the county of st vincent, new south wales was also named in his honour. jervis inlet, in british columbia, canada, was also named for him.  though jervis clearly had a strong impact during the napoleonic wars and afterwards on the development of the navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of jervis are available, and those are seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. the most recent work related to jervis is ""the remaking of the english navy by admiral st. vincent: the great unclaimed naval revolution"" by charles arthur, 1986, but this focused more on jervis's reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. evelyn berkman's ""nelson's dear lord: portrait of st. vincent"" (1962), as the bibliographer eugene rasor points out, is merely an ""effort"" to create a biography. the same bibliographer says much the same about william milbourne james's """"old oak"": the life of john jervis, earl st. vincent"" (1950) and owen sherrard's ""a life of lord st. vincent"" (1933), pointing to both as mediocre. ruddock mackay published an article which documented the early life of jervis.","3, 1, 3, 1, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3","1, 1,

an everyday man off the street—which he contended that he was. the string of good fortune that led to moore becoming influential was sometimes a source of guilt for him. his humble nature and commitment to hard journalism is considered a major contributor to the high quality of twin cities newscasts through the 1990s.  dave moore was born in minneapolis and grew up there. he briefly left the area to work at a battle creek, michigan radio station in 1949, but returned to minneapolis when he learned of job openings at channel 4 in 1950. within an hour of walking into the station, he was working. at this time, the station was known as wtcn, but was purchased by wcco radio in 1952. the wtcn call sign was recycled a few years later for channel 11, which eventually became kare. moore had a variety of jobs in the early years of channel 4, announcing and hosting for multiple programs. he began anchoring the news at 10 p.m. in 1957, then anchored the station's 6 p.m. newscast in 1968. in the mid-70's, moore hosted a news magazine show on wcco tv called ""moore on sunday"", which he hosted until he fell ill in 1997.  moore, with other station personalities, had a penchant for comedy. in 1962 he began ""the bedtime nooz"", originally the ""midnite news,""a satirical late saturday night news show that also featured weatherman bud kraehling and others from the station. this lasted for about a decade, a period during which moore appeared onstage and received acting training at the university of minnesota. moore had wanted to become a stage actor, so ""the bedtime nooz"" and other shows he appeared in offered outlets for his creativity. a most revered stage performance occurred at park square theatre in st. paul, mn, in 1992.","playing ""gramps,"" the production was unique as it was directed by moore's son, peter. the production was considered so successful, that the company revived the show in 1993, due in no small part that the show's co-star, child actor kirk hall, jr. , was going to ""out-grow"" the part of ""pud,"" the grandson of gramps.  wcco is considered by many to have originated the ""happy talk"" often used to attract viewers in modern local newscasts, at least among stations in the twin cities. it has been said that moore's happy talk was merely a result of the camaraderie among the cast rather than a contrived plan, although his acting ability could have fooled people easily. beyond that, however, moore actually resisted many changes over the years to increase viewership. he was not fond of crime reporting, and didn't like using those stories as lead-ins for the news. also, while moore was a strong supporter of women's rights, he didn't like being placed beside a female co-anchor in the 1970s. moore felt that having two people read the news distracted from the stories being told. his first co-anchor was susan spencer, replaced a few years later by pat miles.  moore was a heavy smoker, which contributed his voice growing raspier over the years. even as he aged and sported graying hair, he continued to be a popular figure. he kept busy, hosting the 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 10 p.m. newscasts and producing periodic hour-long documentaries under the name ""the moore report"", for which the station won many prestigious accolades. 1984's ""hollow victory: vietnam under communism"" won a george foster peabody award. the documentary was made after the station spent a year and a half negotiating a 35-day visa to visit the country.  the anchorman's humble nature meant that he did not push for high salaries. while reporters in significant markets around the country negotiated more and more expensive contracts, moore and other newscasters in the twin cities were modestly paid. in 1985, moore stepped down from the 10 p.m. newscast, eventually retiring from the evening news in 1991.  in 1986, moore published his memoirs and correspondence with viewers throughout his career, titled ""a member of the family"" ().  two of moore's sons, andy and pete moore, began working on a play to remember their father's life. they struggled to structure the play, eventually deciding to base it on their own stories and recollections rather than creating a dramatic piece with an actor portraying dave. called ""sons of the bedtime nooz"", it was performed at the great american history theatre in saint paul in early
